"I love how this dipshit keeps saying the water is ""wastefully flowing into the ocean"". This is such an ignorant myopic view of the world. Nature does not exist solely to serve humanity. When rivers meet the ocean they form estuaries, they provide homes for countless plants and animals. If we were to just cut that water off it would be an ecological disaster, the salinity would rise and kill an absurd amount of life. It would disrupt migratory bird cycles and other species like Salmon would no longer be able to reach their spawning grounds. There are countless reasons not to simply take all the water.

And of course, that's not even mentioning how his proposal *doesn't actually do anything to stop the fires*. It doesn't improve our existing infrastructure or vegetation management strategies, or provide more aid to firefighters. All this stunt is designed to do is send more water to the almond farmers in central California and let people like the Resnicks take an even bigger piece of the pie.

"Everyone should read ""The Dreamt Land"" by Mark Arax. I'm reading it now. It's the whole history, up to 2016 when it came out, of water and soil use in central California. 

Trump and his crew don't invent anything new. The themes and tropes covered in this book paint a picture of what to expect from them in regards to water and land policy. (""We have no water because we gave it all to the smelt"" is mentioned more than once in the book, for example.)",01-25-2025,0,0,0
"I have some training with the UC Agriculture and Natural Resources department, and while I‚Äôm not an expert, I wanted to clarify what Trump mentioned at this meeting. Opening ""pumps and valves"" isn‚Äôt really accurate, but there is a real plan to build an underground water tunnel from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California, called the **Delta Conveyance Project**: [https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance](https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance)

A TL;DR of the project:

\- The plan was proposed the 1960s, but the project has been delayed for decades due to debates over costs, logistics, and environmental impacts.

\- It gained traction again in 2016 and was approved by Gavin Newsom in 2019.

To expand on the main challenges: Firstly, the actual cost to build it goes up the longer it's delayed (inflation). Secondly, there are logistical difficulties, as it's a very deep and very long tunnel.  Thirdly, is the environmental impact. This has caused the most contentious debates, as the water tunnel could potentially impact the health of the delta ecosystem.

One example that keeps cropping up is around a species of fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta called the **delta smelt**, which are considered an ""indicator species"". If the smelt have a stable population, the water quality is good. If the smelt population declines, the water quality is bad. Protections for the delta smelt are about the Delta's ecosystem and water quality, rather than the fish specifically. There is more about the environmental impact report for the San Juaquin delta released by the CA Department of Water Resources here: [https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project)",01-25-2025,0,0,0

"Before the aqueduct system, snow melt from the Sierras flowed into the deltas.  California now captures a good portion of that water, and shunts it into the aqueduct system, where it's sent on a long journey south to irrigate fields in the central valley and provide water for millions of people in parts of central and southern California. Enough of the snow melt, however, is still allowed to flow into the deltas to maintain fragile delta ecosystems.

Trump has been wanting the state to shunt more of that water away from the deltas and into the aqueduct system, to make more available for agricultural use and urban populations (powerful California farmers, and developers).

He's now using the devastating fires in the Palisades and Altadena as a pretense for his executive order to take control of California water resources and direct them how he wishes.

Based on his justification, it's a dumb idea because the Santa Ynez reservoir being empty, and the hydrants running dry, are not due to lack of water from the north. The Santa Ynez reservoir had been emptied last February in anticipation of repairs for a tear in its cover. The hydrants ran dry because the demand during the unprecedented fires (estimated to be 25,000 gallons per minute) caused three 1 million gallon water tanks up in the hills to run dry, and the pumping stations could not pump fast enough to meet the demand. However it may not have made a significant difference because the primary issue was that firefighters were facing  firestorm with hurricane force winds that grounded air support, the primary instrument in fighting wildfires.

The claim that shunting more water south to fight fires also ignores the fact that there's no place to hold additional water when existing reservoirs are full, and we have ocean water we can use to fight fires if necessary when the fire is close enough to the coast.",01-27-2025,0,0,0

"Up here in the northern Central Valley for decades the farmers have been fighting against sending more water to LA via the California Aqueduct. Rump is correct that theoretically we could divert more water from the San Joaquin Delta into the Aqueduct but that would mean less water available for farms and orchards, and riparian ecosystems, in the northern Central Valley which is why local farmers (and their environmentalist ‚Äúenemies‚Äù) staunchly oppose doing so.

Up here in the northern CV we are already pumping our aquifers dry, to the point where the ground is subsiding and residential wells are failing, in spite of the annual snowmelt retained in reservoirs that flows through the canal system to irrigate crops. There already isn‚Äôt enough water to meet demand, especially in drought years when farmers are often forced to let their crops and orchards die for lack of water.

The huge farms in Imperial County get their water from the Colorado River via a separate canal system. The water sent down the Aqueduct largely goes to supply homes and businesses in southern CA, or in the words of northern CV farmers ‚Äúnothing but pools and golf courses‚Äù. They despise the LA region for always demanding more water almost as much as they despise the Delta smelt, an endangered fish species that has become a target because of the small percentage of water allowed to flow out of reservoirs and down the rivers to barely sustain the riparian and Delta ecosystems and prevent salt water intrusion, something local farmers consider ‚Äúa waste of precious water‚Äù. 

I guarantee that neither northern CV farmers nor the environmental community want to send more water down south. It‚Äôll be interesting to see whether the local farmers‚Äô love for Rump overrides their own economic self-interest. If they finally cave in to his demands to ‚Äúopen the spigot‚Äù into the Aqueduct, after decades of ferociously opposing doing so, it will be yet another sign that Rump worship has become the overriding factor that controls their lives.",01-26-2025,0,0,0

but if we're talking lets see California water reservoir...tax payers funded hundreds of millions of development in what wa the kern water bank.  Resnick's(who use more water than the entire population of los angeles, more than any other business, farm, etc)  notoriously was a huge donor to every politician, but the couple had a special friendship with Dianne Feinstein who they hosted for fundraisers both in Beverly Hills and Aspen.  Dianne Feinstein took up their cause holding closed door meetings wihch ended with that public resource being privatized with the Resnick's becoming major owners with the rights to sell back water to cities even. It was an easy sweet heart deal.   She also lobbied for the public to fund more studies after they wrote to her saying it was 'sloppy science' despite the studies ended up showing they were sound, just costing tax payers because her donor told her so.

From our tax dollars being funded to billionaires for arena deals, war contracts, or even amendments & bills we like being negotiated favorably for industry our 'public servants' have mastered"" socializing the cost, privatizing the profits"" usually for people who buy them out relatively cheaply to make the cost of doing business for corps include even massives fines baked in and still be profitable.  

This is just one compartment, and its not an attack on left or right bc i those people like yourself are principled, but really an indicmentt of our so called 'public servants' who time and time again take the power and resources we entrust them to and give it off to the higher bidder or compromise enough crumbs for the people for PR while working in partnership with corporations and their donors meanwhile divide and conquer people with blind  tribalism of saying the other side is the problem.  And nothing has been as old as time as giving and funneling anger towards a common enemy and it simply working to divide and conquer

1. What having a directional drying hurricane without water coming from the sky is like.
2. What 8+ mos of no rain following 2 years of wet seasons that produced lush vegetation is like. (1 spark of anything is dangerous as all hell) 3. How those same winds prevented air response for well past the first 24 hrs. Our first aerials to assess couldn't even be done from a close enough range for effective response. As soon as the could do so they did.
4. It was so much spread so quickly, and the response has been non-stop.
5. Pre-regular fire season they were cutting brush, doing strategic controlled burns in the areas needed. The responded and put out fires all summer and fall more than adequately.... from car fires, arson, wildfires, and structure fires.

The fire crews of the city and the county work non-stop to keep our city from burning down. They respond to power lines down, and so many other critical emergencies. The crews in each part of the city know their territory so well. Firetrucks & ambulances know how and practice safely navigating through some sick traffic to tight canyon roads with huge vehicles in their responses. These people save lives regularly. Anytime I see a crew from the beach, or downtown, in the air by the foothills, or in a suburban neighborhood I know they have our backs, I feel safer, and I am proud to know they are part of the community.

Please encourage anyone you know personally who may be sucked in by all the politically driven garbage on msm news outlets or socials all looking for engagement or to push agendas to think logically or educate themselves with a bit of science (elementary physics, geology, enviro, chem... anything).

I was like yes, I've lived here my whole life. I know what the Santa Ana winds are, yes I know they're strong. The days of the fire were a whole other level. I have never seen them blow like that. Plus no rain at all this winter. Disastrous conditions.

 Australia has been having giant mega fires, they are struggling with dry conditions, like CA and have more outback. The one in 2020 was 25M acres, and almost wiped out entire animal species. Last year again millions of acres burned.

What I do find interesting more generally is that insurance companies doing so is a defensive strategy to save money. When it comes to spending as a collective whole, there is denial and hesitation at play. Of course, these things should be examined as appropriate after any natural disaster. We are in the middle of a reaction response and hoping the current, albeit smaller windstorm, doesn't exacerbate things/further spread or delay getting things under control. 

For example: armchair experts aka people that don't understand the fundamentals of pressurized municiple water systems or that think hydrants are a well of sorts trying to point fingers at the smallest thing their minds can grasp bc xyz news or their fav celeb or ticktocker person told them was fact. These are the same people call and complain when they are notified of scheduled hydrant flushes (told they will lose pressure during set hours for maintenance) that don't understand why, and then call to complain. 

We have become idocracy and, as a whole, society makes decisions driven by capitalism and greed.

Every other fire fighter and chief that‚Äôs been on TV or elsewhere, every fire expert I‚Äôve seen has said point blank, no amount of resources could have changed this outcome (unless there were literally a completely different municipal water system in place ‚Äî one that doesn‚Äôt exist. Or perhaps unless they just had water tankers on standby in random neighborhoods and thousands more fire fighters on standby as well).

As for the water. I absolutely would not be surprised that there wasn‚Äôt  water pressure when that woman went to get water. As people were evacuating, they were even told to shut off their own water to support the pressure going out to hydrants. Again, the point is that the entire water system is not designed to have that much water in use at the same time. The water pressure does not hold. 

There‚Äôs a lot to be said about the failing infrastructure in the US and the lack of updates (a 40 year old issue), but I‚Äôm not sure why people are pretending that updating an entire municipal water system to accommodate running hundreds or thousands of fire hydrants simultaneously is a fix that can come in 2, 4 or even 8 years. The infrastructure changes needed to combat the effects of climate change obviously need to be made, and the entire government fails at that (and constituents allow them to ‚Äî because really, do we think all these people would‚Äôve supported spending billions of dollars on what they perceive to be pipes and water projects?).

What *I did say* is that most if not every fire fighter who has publicly spoken, with the exception of Crowley, has said that no amount of resources would have made a difference **in this scenario**.

So I already know you didn't look at it -- it was firefighters saying explicitly that there is no water system or amount of firefighters that would have prevented the scale of this disaster.

Here are few more:

[\- US Fire Admin](https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/fema-us-fire-admin-la-blazes/)

But perhaps it's your assertion that all of these people are lying or that *you* know better than them. 

Someone saying that 200 firefighters wouldn't have prevented the scale of this disaster is not saying that those resources aren't needed. Unless what, ‚Äúthis was all preventable‚Äù was about 200 firefighters attempting to save 5 more houses?

You have to build new answers and that‚Äôs what the resources and money were asked for and the people who denied it were told what would happen - and now it has.

Your links want us to believe that answering questions like, when does the water run out and, where do we get more water from when it does - wouldn‚Äôt have helped. Or that having more firefighters wouldn‚Äôt have helped. Even though they themselves called in more firefighters and even though private individuals hired their own firefighters and brought in their own water - we‚Äôre supposed to believe that doesn‚Äôt work?

Show me the computer model where having more firefighters and more water doesn‚Äôt have an impact on the fire. Or better yet, show me the fire chief that said they got the funding for a multi-departmental worst case scenario training, they went through all the data, found the water limitations and every solution they re-ran it with, everything still burned down. And no matter how many firefighters they added, everything still burned down. No matter how many extra water trucks they had, everything still burned down.

You have three people who say water and extra fire fighters don‚Äôt have any impact on the outcome of a fire and who have not one hind sight recommendation - not one.

> It seems like in the end, he didn‚Äôt withhold aid and the media had to give it a spin to justify their fear mongering.

There is no ""spin"" or ""fear mongering"". Again, he *literally* withheld aid until he was convinced to change his mind.

We also know about how Trump changed his views on things based on whether it would hurt the wrong people not because of an ""anonymous source"" but rather the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Resilience Policy on the National Security Council Staff (Mark Harvey).

>People in this sub can never make up their mind to if Trump is a dictator who exerts total control, or if he‚Äôs a weak facile puppet who is controlled by these ‚Äúanonymous sources‚Äù.

Every president has had people around them giving them advice/information and those people will often influence a decision. You're free to think that makes Trump a ""weak facile puppet"", though. But the reality is only that he had people around him who realized that Trump withholding aid wasn't just going to hurt Democrats but also their fellow Republicans.

As for the dictator part, sounds like you're creating arguments in your head or you simply can't remember who you're talking to. Either way you should get that checked out.

"For those saying ""it costs too much to eat out"" remember that restaurants need to buy food, for the little guys, close to or at the same prices you pay to eat at home. And then have to pay for staff to prep all the food and serve the food. And pay electricity (that's expensive for everyone), and trash, and water, and gas, and credit card processing, and napkins, and laundering, and chemicals, and taxes. And the list goes on. That's why it's gotten more expensive. 
Your complaints are valid only if the food is sub par. But for the good places, you are paying for no prep, no clean up, etc. And if you keep crying about prices, they will only get more expensive as the places that care and make delicious food go under, and places that can mass produce meh food survive. Have some compassion and try to understand what's happening to make these prices go up. (Not defending people that price gouge, but I garuntee you as a restaurant owner, most places are not, they are barely making it)",01-25-2025,0,0,0

"The funny thing is that for most of American history, ""eating out"" *was* a luxury. It was something families did maybe once every 4-6 months. It was a special occasion and not something people did weekly or even monthly, let alone every other day.

It wasn't until the late 90s/early 00s with low interest rates (which lead to increased credit card useage), the explosion of fast casual options (Chipotle, Cava and their ilk are all relatively new), and the increase in working hours (people were now working longer than 9-5 without a partner at home to actually *cook dinner* and make lunches for the next day) that we started relying on restaurants for our meals.

We're just returning to normal now: eating out is a luxury. With interest rates high (and likely to rise, idc what anyone says), people are going to cut down on credit card useage and work with the cash they have in their bank account.

I don't know. I really don't. I'm not an expert on Japan; I just have very close friends living there. They work too hard, the Japanese ones, because yeah, it's part of their culture, but they seem to generally like being Japanese for some reason--something transcends the tough expectations, maybe a sense of shared, cultural struggle or comradery. My best friend there and his wife really want to move from Tokyo to Okinawa, though. And they're in a very nice part of Tokyo and very well-connected to the fashion industry and associated celebrity culture nearby (Azabu-Juban). I guess anything can get old.

I've been five times, but there is this sameness or Japanese-ness that eventually gets somehow kind of boring eventually: it's all tiny variations on the same thing, and the range of possibilities is narrowed by cultural strictures somehow.

Honestly don‚Äôt know which was worse. 

I‚Äôve watched 23 alcoholics die from this disease since I started mentoring and sponsoring other sufferers and working with an emergency response team from my SF AA fellowship. I have seen several people die from AAWS and the convulsions were terrifying. I know exactly how those could snap your spine. JFC, yo. I‚Äôm so sorry. 

40 companies???!! I‚Äôve owned six in my life and I thought that was insane! 

Letting go of my desire to recover my previous financial status and recognizing that my disabilities (mental and physical) would probably never allow me to do so in a way that didn‚Äôt destroy what‚Äôs left of my health was a tough thing to accept but also very liberating. I was pronounced 100% disabled for combat injuries (not in service of the US so no vet benefits) in 2018 but continued to earn money so only started receiving SSDI payments after that dried up in the pandemic when COVID and my back did me in. I live on $1200 a month and $180 of food stamps now and have for the past three years. It‚Äôs incredibly hard but I am lucky to have a very seaworthy sailboat and the skills to sail it and maintain it anywhere. I‚Äôm technically homeless because I live in a ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù but my home is much nicer than most people‚Äôs who are making three or four times what I bring in. I have to hit food pantries sometimes now because my fixed income has not even vaguely moved with inflation, especially when it comes to groceries. I have medi-Cal managing my Medicare benefits and receive all my healthcare for free. 

So I basically have UBI and universal healthcare in this shithole banana republic of a superpower. I paid an insanely heavy price to get it and it is barely enough to survive, but if I had to try to hustle every day the way I used to and the way it takes to build anything worthwhile I would not make it. Something would break irreparably in my life, for sure. But, I cannot begin to express how worth it is to just check the fuck out of the rat race and live like a pauper completely removed from the burdens of hyper-consumerism and late-stage, unregulated capitalism in a de-educated and radicalized society.

"If the minimum wage was constantly being adjusted to a living wage, like I assume it is in the UK, I'd totally agree. Unfortunately, in the US, the minimum wage is a joke. Our tipping culture is a weird and broken system that helps overcome our even more broken minimum wage. By virtue of the fact that a culturally appropriate tip is 15%-25% of your bill, and the fact that restaurant owners will always take care to adjust menu prices to account for inflation, this helps ensure that the money servers take home stays a living wage over time. As a result, serving tables at a restaurant is something that can be done as an actual career by the skilled people who can do it well in a busy restaurant.

I personally think that every job should afford the people working it the option to make it a career, and that everyone working a full time job in such a rich country should be paid enough to afford a minimum standard of living.

SCE is taking shit from both directions. There are people criticizing it for not cutting the power to prevent fires, and there are people criticizing it for cutting the power to prevent fires.

Just what exactly is SCE supposed to do?

Am a California native, but live on the other coast these days. Our utility gets massive opposition from manufacturers and advocates for the poor anytime it proposes spending additional money on hardening the grid. Doesn't even have to ask for a surcharge, just has to identify the projects and critics come out of the woodwork and say no, we don't need those, dump them and pass the savings on to ratepayers. It's madness.

Undergrounding everything here is a 10-figure expense. No shortage of people who came out of the woodwork after an ice storm to advocate for undergrounding, but they shut up right quick after the cost was pointed out to them. They'd rather freeze than fork over a few more dollars each month.

Undergrounding wires in California is probably a 12-figure expense. There's not enough profit in utilities to cover that by making them take a haircut. You want the grid hardened, you have to open your wallet. There's no other way.",01-30-2025,0,0,0

I think we need a serious conversation about the role of home insurance, though. Private insurance is a bad model for healthcare because healthcare can be very random as it is influenced by things out of your control, like your genetic baggage. However, the home insurance market in California is broken by well-intended but bad regulations. We don't allow insurance companies to use climate models to put a price on the increased risk of insuring properties in fire areas. The risk is very real, as we've seen with these recent fires, or in Paradise and Santa Rosa. It's not sustainable, but because insurance companies can't price in risk appropriately, they then jack up the premiums for everyone, even if they are not in a fire area. It's the equivalent of car insurance trying to charge the same for someone who drives a Corolla, and someone who drives a Porsche. Between Prop 103, which distorted our home insurance market, and prop 13, younger people with who tend to have fewer means are subsidizing the older residents who tend to be wealthier and live in the foothills.

"Another part of this is, at least in some states, there‚Äôs no required disclosure of these risks when buying homes (it‚Äôs a huge issue with Florida and flooding, where at least a few years ago they didn‚Äôt have to disclose whether a home has been flooded or not).

I feel a lot of ppl don‚Äôt even really think about that sort of thing, natural disasters, when buying a home (particularly since often the most desirable places to live, like the coast or mountains, are the most risky). So they may buy the house with no clue at all it was previously burnt down (even w this fire‚ÄîI think it‚Äôll be super easy for some rich person from New York to move to LA in five years, after things are semi normal, and buy a house in the palisades w no clue that house was actually at risk; even more so for places like Altadena, which are less well known). Then, with insurance, it can be impossible to move out once a disaster, naturally, occurs again when you don‚Äôt have disposable income. 

I feel the insurance market needs to become wayyyyy more transparent taking climate risks into account and detailing the natural disasters a neighborhood has been through. The real estate market also should be held accountable when there‚Äôs no disclosure of material facts like this, where many would be like ‚Äúthis whole neighborhood burned down and is at risk of burning down again????

"See this report:**How Citizen Enforcement of Proposition 103 has Saved Californians $5.5 Billion ‚Äì and Why the Insurance Industry Hates It**

When California‚Äôs insurance regulator operated behind closed doors, the insurance companies always won. Insurance premiums soared, people were denied insurance for no legitimate reason, and insurance companies reaped windfall profits. That‚Äôs why, when California voters passed the nation‚Äôs most sweeping reform of the insurance industry in 1988, they authorized consumers to independently challenge excessive insurance premiums and unfair practices‚Äîto take on the legions of lawyers, lobbyists, and actuaries that insurance companies always hire to get their way. Proposition 103 also gave the public the power to make sure the Insurance Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance (CDI) obey the law. The initiative requires insurance companies to pay the costs when consumers do so.

Outside parties using the intervenor process collect money when the insurance companies are caught violating the law, through court fees. If insurance companies did not continue to try to ignore the law, there would be no need for the intervenor. Also, if the insurance commissioner did this instead of rubber stamping all insurance increases, then outside parties would not need to. The intervenor process has saved CA policy holders billions of dollars in overcharges, while the intervenor collects a tiny percentage of that, from insurance companies. 

CA should require insurance companies to cover homeowners that take steps to mitigate wildfire damage.

Everything above this sentence is wrong. California has invested substantially in water infrastructure and has over the past 6 years passed multiple significant laws making it easier for housing to be built. 

The State had a $100b surplus after the stock market bounced back from the COVID crash because the state utilizes a progressive income tax system, so when the stock market surges and the tech bros sell their RSUs the state gets a windfall. 

State income taxes are the highest in the country, but the property taxes are criminally low compared to the value of the homes that are being taxed. The average Texan pays more in taxes per year than the average Californian.

The hazard categories are already based on the modeled probability of a particular property experiencing a fire and the expected fire characteristics.

I work in disease risk prediction, so I'll use that as an example.  Telling someone that they are at ""high risk"" of developing breast cancer is somewhat meaningless in a vacuum and certainly doesn't give enough detailed information to be a helpful basis to make difficult decisions like whether they should get preventative surgery (which itself carries risk and downsides).  Instead you might communicate their lifetime probability of developing the disease, or at early stages of the disease, their expected 5-year survival probability before and after different interventions.  This isn't to say that disease progression isn't highly heterogeneous and difficult to predict at an individual level, similar you point out with wildfire hazard to specific properties.  But we can still communicate our best probabilistic estimates based on what we know, particularly when those estimates are already the sole basis of the categorical hazard labels we're assigning anyway.

Remember, in a sense every probabilistic statement is wrong.  The truth is 0 or 1; your property either will or won't burn in the next decade.  But the probability characterizes our uncertainty in order to help make decisions.  Whether or not to move is a huge decision for families.

No, that's a false claim. The codes that are on the books weren't tested because they weren't in place in the old buildings that burned.

"Concrete itself is fairly non combustible, most buildings above a certain occupancy size will generally need to be constructed out of non combustible materials (offices, schools, hospitals) in a mix of concrete and steel.  Wood is just substantially cheaper to build out of for lower occupancy buildings.  

Insulated concrete form isn't more or less fire proof than regular concrete, it's just a construction methodology. 
 Regular concrete walls you build up temporary formwork that's removed after the concrete is cured.  Insulated concrete forms is just foam formwork that's left in place afterwards and not removed.  It can be cheaper depending on your use, or worse depending on your use, but doesn't necessarily change the fire rating.  You can always add insulation to the regularly cast concrete wall.

Since the insulated formwork itself can't be left as your finish the same way concrete is able to, that means you need additional exterior finishes, depending on what you use to cover the foam it could be even more combustible than a regular concrete wall.  But I think typically insulated forms are used with red brick finish; which in terms of seismic is pretty bad and a lot of additional seismic mass.

"Surprisingly enough, most of what survived were the trees.  Especially the pine trees of which there are tons in Altadena.  If you look at the pictures closely, you'll see even in the totally destroyed neighborhoods, a lot of the trees survived.  Insulating concrete form sounds interesting.  I hope it's as good as it sounds and I also hope there are regulations in place to require new builds to use it if it works.  From my perspective (I was actively fighting fires near Lincoln and Woodbury) the buildings themselves were the worst problem of all, far worse than trees and debris.  The thing is, I also know of houses that had metal roofing and concrete walls that burned down.  Maybe if they were all built like that it would have mitigated the problem, but the interiors of houses are always somewhat flammable no matter what you do, and even those robust houses couldn't survive being completely surrounded.  It's kind of weird though typing it out because in the same paragraph I said pine trees can survive but metal and concrete houses can't.  But... that's what I saw.  Actually the very house I am describing with a metal roof and concrete walls that was in my parents neighborhood had a partially built back house they were working on that was literally just two by four wood framing, and it survived while their house did not.  I guess all I can really say with certainty is there is an element of randomness to what burns and what doesn't that seems to not care too much about what building materials are used.  Enough heat and wind concentrated on a spot seems like it can take almost anything out.  I definitely want to see better materials used in the rebuild though.

I do think that preventing price-hikes in this specific setting makes sense too. It's not like the rich are going to rent more properties just because they can (though tbh some assholes might). Immediate hikes for current renters would also be pretty clear price-gouging too.¬†


The problem however is that ideally you need systems to ensure equitable distribution of resources set up before the disaster strikes. It's very hard to be ethical if you don't without making the situation worse. Disaster is when the government is supposed to step in not the free market. If you have favored the latter over the former to the extent that you lack certain tools your ability to be ethical effectively is severely diminished.


For example, there could be a mandate and funding for basic temporary accomodation for all. That would give the authorities one hell of a good negotiating position when discussing with any lanlord. Price-controls are an act of desperation, mismanagement and/or poor planning. You should demand more of your elected leaders.

Yes, they keep them off the market until they can force rents to be driven high enough to where it's more of a profit to lease them at a later date and during this entire process they get to write off their other income as a result of the tactic while they continue to take up properties and force them off the market to drive rents even higher. It's the literal tactic of what De Beers did with diamond distribution.

If the new normal is 2000 structures burnt from wildfires per year, like has so far happened with this fire, with 13,000,000 homes in the state, this give a 1 in 6500 chance each year wildfires will burn your house down. 

If a person gets $1,000,000 on average to rebuild, every household would need to pay an additional $150 a year to cover this additional risk.  This doesn't seem like a huge amount for home owners to cover. (And if you have a home worth $10 million, you should have to pay 10x that amount).

The assumption here is that, even though 2000 homes is a lot, it is still a small number compared to total homes in the state.

Did the wildfire risk suddenly get 3x higher? Or is perhaps the risk not actually being priced as accurately as it should be

"You can't simply declare ""people should choose to live somewhere else, then"" without a comprehensive plan for that ""somewhere else."" Otherwise you're pushing the responsibility for a ""societal concern"" onto individuals, which is ***even more unfair*** than pushing it onto a large corporate industry.

For example, a large group of the people who lost homes to the Eaton fire are employees at the Jet Propulsion Lab, a NASA facility worth probably tens or hundreds of billions of dollars that has been in Pasadena since the 1930s. If you work at JPL, you likely are going to live in a place with high fire risk because...those are the places near JPL. The stretch along the Angeles Crest mountains and the Verdugo hills, maybe down towards north central LA into the hills around Highland Park... it's all in the fire zone.

So what's your answer for these people if they ""aren't supposed to choose to live in a high risk zone""? Stop working for NASA and go somewhere else? Commute 1-2 hours from a lower-risk zone (that would immediately wind up overcrowded if everyone in a high risk zone in LA moved to low risk zones)? Move a hundred-billion dollar NASA facility to a place with no environmental risk?

It's so fucking easy to just say ""societal issue, just live somewhere else 'till society sorts it out.""

"This [report](https://lhc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Reports/221/Report221.pdf) was on the governor‚Äôs desk back in 2014 and predicts every issue CA is facing today due to climate change in depth. Democrats have done nothing despite being warned by everyone. Republicans are even worse in that they have tried (and succeeded in many cases) to reverse progress. There is nothing any of us can do besides watch the world burn. 



‚ÄúThe Commission calls for the Governor and Legislature to create a new state entity or enhance the capacity of an existing state organization to establish and share the best-available state science and risk assessment procedures for anticipated climate impacts. The Commission envisions this organization becoming the authoritative source for local and regional governments to connect in two-way exchanges with the state for assessment of their climate risks. Critical to the organization‚Äôs performance in establishing the best-available information for decision-making will be inclusion of views from local governments, business and the private sector. Models for such an organization already exist within state government.

The Commission also calls for the California Strategic Growth Council to expand its focus beyond emissions reduction to fund stronger climate adaptation in cities, counties and regions. The council‚Äôs mission to steer more residential and commercial development to existing urban areas has potential to unwittingly move more people and property into harm‚Äôs way. An expanded focus on climate impacts and adaptation will help balance state growth policies with those of climate adaptation.

Finally, the Commission calls for more aggressive enforcement of defensible space requirements to minimize property damage from wildfires, and for the Governor to work with key state agencies to clarify the impact of sea level rise on property rights under California‚Äôs Common Law Public Trust doctrine.‚Äù",01-09-2025,0,0,0

"It would be good to see verification that this is actually what happened, yes, but most importantly we need to know the timing and what the funds were for. Sounds like if the account Bloomenfield‚Äôs office gives is accurate then those funds were for raises for existing staff, which means that the cuts to staffing which are the source of controversy happened irregardless.

People focused excessively on the dollar amounts, which led to lots of posts here ‚Äúdebunking‚Äù the cuts because ‚Äúactually the budget increased by $53 million‚Äù. What actually matters are the material consequences of the budget allocation and the overall timeline.

What seems likely is that the budget cuts happened, which led to material changes (e.g. maybe a decline in staffing in certain departments) that the LAFD warned could impact its capabilities. The $53 million was then set aside for costs that are not as closely related to LAFD‚Äôs capabilities (eg raises for existing staff). 

You can raise issues here about the efficiency of the distribution of funds but my point is that there are real questions about whether or the LAFD is sufficiently funded in the context of those initial cuts and their consequences.

TLDR; the $53 million is being presented as undoing the $17 million in cuts, but this is not likely to be the case because the 53 million was earmarked for things other than what was impacted by the cuts. People need to stop just sharing these numbers as if they mean something by themselves and start talking specifics in terms of what actual resources or processes were hurt or helped by the most recent round of budgeting decisions.",01-10-2025,0,0,0

Why is everyone always so quick to view any system failure as the fault of the system, and not as an extreme event that the system wasn't designed to handle?

It is a firefighter's worst nightmare out there right now and it's hard to believe *any* infrastructure can be built to handle it. No amount of money could've stopped this.

When extreme events such as the Palisades fire happen, the most we can hope for is damage mitigation. That means some losses are inevitable, of people and property, and the best that can be done is to limit it as much as possible.

It also supplies water to major urban centers in the Greater Sacramento and San Francisco Bay areas"" and ""provides water to restore and protect fish and wildlife, and to enhance water quality,"" according to the bureau.

The Central Valley Project *does not send water to Southern California*. It sends water to the Central Valley, mainly the San Joaquin Valley, and primarily for agricultural use. **IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WATER TO LOS ANGELES**. The *State Water Project* sends water to Southern California.

Seriously, here's the CVP's [list of water users](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvp-water/docs/latest-water-users.pdf).

"So the water from N. California's Sacramento River (i.e. that feeds the Delta that's the habitat of the Delta Smelt)  is stored in two reservoirs:  Pyramid Lake and Castaic Lake.  

At the time the fires broke out Pyramid was full and Castaic was at 75%. After the fires were contained Pyramid was full and Castaic was at 75%. Diverting more water from N. Cal. has zero, zilch, nothing to do with the response to these fires. 

N. California has had a solid rain year, with a stark dry line starting S. of Monterey Bay where the winter rainfall has tapered off to nothing by the time you reach So. California.  

L.A. blends the water from several sources: Sacramento River/Feather River, Owens River, Colorado River and ground water to get the right pH and dissolved solids for the water infrastructure.  Communities like Altadena and Palisades don't get water from any one source, and this year, due to the solid rains in the north and water stored from last year, LA has plenty of water from all sources. 

However opening dozens of fire hydrants at the same time is a recipe for zero water pressure. Fire hydrants are designed to be able to maintain huge flow rates and even just opening a more than a handful for a major structure fire can drop water pressure quickly. There's no municipal water system in the world that could keep up with a huge rain of wind driven embers igniting half the town all at once.

"Hypothesis: Santa Ynez Reservoir would have saved Palisades.

Crazy to think we could conduct Scientific Method on this, but this is the extremely rare event that we can actually test this hypothesis since we had 2 fires under the exact same weather conditions. Amazing that we have a test and a control.
 
Test: Palisades with access to Santa Ynez.

Control: Eaton with no access whatsoever to Santa Ynez.


Results?

Palisades: 1200 structures destroyed, 5300 structures damaged, 8 dead

Eaton: 1400 structures destroyed, 7200 structures damaged, 16 dead.

Conclusion: Alta Dena, who was straight mainlined into the city water system with limitless water had MORE damage than Palisades. 

My personal hypothesis: The viscious weather conditions that grounded air operations and rapidly spread this fire made this a losing battle. There is not enough fire personnel in a vicinity anywhere in the world that could have responded in time to change the outcome. Even if you had the personnel, the air operations would have been absolutely critical to fighting the fire. It was a 1 + 1 = 2 situation to stop it and the fire was just too fast and too strong for any of it.",01-14-2025,0,0,0

There is much land that isn't suitable for forestry, agriculture, or animal husbandry.   It is just too steep, or has crummy soil, or a host of other things.   The land is cheap so people like to build houses out there if possible, which is part of the problem.    
  
So, there isn't a way to do this for free.  The opposition to state politicians want to cut everything possible, lower taxes whenever possible, and cut services and regulations as much possible.   This doesn't put out or prevent fires, so I don't know what you expect to happen.

Also, as a million people have said, nothing is going to mitigate 80-100mph winds with very low humidity.  State governments in Florida can't stop hurricanes either.

""Central Valley Project

In the 1930s, the federal government got involved, building the Central Valley Project (CVP) to support the arid but fertile Central Valley and its agricultural economy.

I won‚Äôt be assessing her from microphone moments especially in the onslaught of misinformation that literally doesn‚Äôt hold any water. Her effect will be seen over the recovery effort. That goes the same for the governor and every political leader on upwards involved from here.

I‚Äôd also add that the alternative to Mayor Bass was Rick Caruso during the last election. He‚Äôs the one that wingnutted this whole reservoir misinformation campaign. If you are looking for poor leadership on the microphone, I found your guy.",01-15-2025,0,0,0

People not agreeing is how you know you live in a democracy, and California is incredibly effective in so many ways.

Why remove democracy if it works so well?  What is so great about anywhere else that we would need to copy it?

To people that say it doesn't, what has your part of the country done for me lately?

States that can hold their own outside of oil or tax payer dollars from somewhere else never ever hassle us.  Lots of places have oil, and taxpayer funded bureaucracy, but not many places innovate and keep an entire culture ahead, by which I mean we benefit the entire fucking country consistently. The oil will run out someday, and it just makes you lazy.

If California pays for your state more than you do for us, why don't you fuck off and mind your own business about how we are governed, if you can't pull your own weight?

We specifically said that any donated clothes would be made available to children whose families couldn't afford the uniform, and a few would be kept in reserve for days when a kid accidentally peed themself, or got paint spilled on them in art class, etc.

It was stunning how many dirty or damaged clothes were thrown in the donation bag.  And that was when people were choosing to donate at their leisure, it wasn't a crisis situation with an immediate need.  I usually just rewashed everything to be on the safe side.",01-30-2025,0,0,0

"The free market is highly touted by economists for a reason. By letting people and firms engage in commerce freely, prices ensure that allocation is fair. There are flaws of course, but it works well.

Higher profits attract more investment, and entrepreneurs will start new businesses, expanding the supply to meet demand, and keeping prices at ‚Äúequilibrium,‚Äù the famous meeting point between the supply and demand curves.

Prices are going up in excess of inflation and have been for decades. Why hasn‚Äôt supply grown to meet demand? Because it‚Äôs illegal! What is the result? Well, the supply curve moves to the left, making the equilibrium point meet at a lower supply and higher price.

When I first came to realize how burdensome shelter costs were becoming I asked, what is causing prices to go up and identified at least 16 reasons, many of which were government. My judgement (and the judgement of most economists) is that the most impactful cause of rising shelter costs was the artificial shortage that NIMBYism was creating.

The Great Housing Shortage is caused by NIMBYs. Historically, housing is not an asset that outpaces GDP growth because the many, many homebuilding companies keep the price of construction competitive. This kept many corps away from investing in housing, except homebuilders, who cannot be called an exploitative industry. However, the artificial shortage has caused housing to outpace GDP. In many states, including California, corps are further attracted by low property taxes, accelerating the profitability of investments in land (which is what blackrock really wants).

You want to resist corps speculating in housing out of spite for corps.

I just want people to have cheap housing.

Your solution, banning corps, would drastically decrease the quality and the supply of housing in the US over the next few decades while enriching local landlords and landladies.

My solution, letting the market decide what to build, where to build, and how much to charge, will end The Great Housing Shortage, bring housing prices back in line, and make land speculation a less attractive proposition for Corps, driving them away not in spite, but in making a fair market for working, renting, non-home owning folks.

We are not the same.

You are literally a decade of research and study and political advocacy behind me. Question my motives, I‚Äôve knocked thousands of doors for City Council candidates who want to build housing, going back to 2018.¬†

Anti corp rhetoric is valid in many ways.

Be thoughtful it‚Äôs a big and complicated world.

The Great Housing Shortage is not their fault.

It‚Äôs your city council‚Äôs fault, and the sympathetic mom and pop landlords who dress themselves up as working class but are in reality siphoning away the wealth of their community, taking for themselves the sweat of other people‚Äôs brow.

In response to these laws almost every city council has dragged their feet. Several hundred have worked to actively oppose it. The most common tactic the last two years has been to charge punitive development fees to homebuilders to get them to fuck off. Once those are banned, they will surely invent new shmchemes to try construction.

There are a few dozen states who actively fight these laws, not just feet dragging and circumventing but refusing to adopt them and going to court to resist them.

As a result the Attorney General and the Housing Department are overwhelmed. Enforcement is like a giant game of whack a mole, deal with one cities intransigence and 150 cities follow suit. Each one must be dealt with individually.

I have to disagree with you there: A home is an investment and, when you make a bad investment, you should feel some financial pain. If the property value drops due to insurance skyrocketing, that's an investment performing poorly. The government shouldn't bail out bad investments because:

1. It increases risk taking behavior. These homeowners would cash in their bail out bucks and buy another high risk property, knowing that the government will be there to bail them out if the value tanks. 

2. It's regressive; It shifts funds from taxpayers and gives us to people who are, mostly, quite wealthy.",02-04-2025,0,0,0
"The problem is that insurance companies are supposed to be in the risk-taking business.  But apparently no one told them  - or us - that.  They profit for years while nothing bad happens and then when something does, they expect someone other than themselves to ultimately pay the cost.  In other words, they were never taking a risk to begin with - or at least that's how they want it to be.  

If they were really taking risks, then yes, occasionally an insurance company might fail.  That should be ok, but instead we seem to have applied a ""too big to fail"" label to all of them.  It would encourage them to manage risks and yes, they should be allowed to charge what it really costs.  Instead they just seek to shift costs to other parties after the fact.  And ultimately that does more harm than good.  Not only is that fundamentally unfair, but high insurance costs would discourage people from living in high risk areas.  It'd be nice if the government would be more involved in doing that by, I don't know, making zoning laws with that in mind, but since they won't, high insurance rates might be the next best thing.

Edit: also, I don‚Äôt know specifically what fire zone Altadena would be, I‚Äôm sure it varies depending how far from the wooded area. But if it‚Äôs in at least a mid-tier risk zone then its value would not have gone up so much over the years due to fire insurance costs.

That's just to bring the case to trial.

One thing that remains top of mind for me is how EPA acceptable levels might still lead to pretty impactful health issues. In other words, just because it‚Äôs deemed acceptable by heath agencies it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not harmful long-term.

As a (very flawed) example, we have ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù levels of lead in our municipal water system but we know no amount of lead exposure is truly safe. IIRC, our accepted levels is x3 higher than most other developed nations. 

So the elevated volumes of air toxins that fall below the 0.15 line here might still be pretty significantly harmful. A meta-analysis of studies about pollution might be the best thing to do next.",01-20-2025,0,0,0

Once a child‚Äôs exposure to lead stops, the amount of lead in the blood decreases gradually. The child‚Äôs body releases some of the lead through urine, sweat, and feces.

"It's an age old issue.

People form two camps:

""We're all going to die."" Characterized as overly emotional and irrational.

And ""This is fine."" Characterized as unthinking hubris.

It's well documented that the more common psychological response to disaster is to attempt to normalize everything so we can regulate ourselves. 

We all want this to go away so, if we return to normal life, it effectively does. Humans will gobble up anything that will confirm that very natural and logical bias.

Sometimes during a raging barn fire, horses will run back into the barn. It's where they have always been safe.

The challenge with the ""This is fine."" camp is illustrated by your response. 

Looking at one sample of data from a hyper local place, 10 miles from one fire, with one contaminant to demonstrate everything is fine. Anyone with concerns is called hysterical.

It's great Pico Rivera seems lovely in this snapshot. It's hopeful. No denying that.

It also means very little when trying to determine the extent of risk across the county.

Arguments like, ""We're always above EPA levels."" are tabled to be reductive when, logically, the fact that we are normally above EPA levels and then have a **massive, acute** event should be more concerning. 

""It's ok we got a dump of poison in the city because the city is always a little poisonous."" 

It's about as logical as saying, ""It's ok you were bitten by a rattlesnake, you get stung by wasps all the time.""

All of the data in this post is on complete discord with the fact that the fires did not occur in one hyper local area 10 miles from the fire, the effects of wind dispersal are wildly difficult to predict, there is not one but dozens of life threatening contaminants which are with different weights and probable distances of travel (some well documented to be thousands of miles).

How far do the particles travel? How dilute do they get? Not sure. No data at all about that here but ""It'll be fine"".

Because? 

Based on data from the Camp Fire and Colorado Fires. This is unlikely to be fine.

Then there are the inherent issues with the data visualization.

If a graph shows a spike where we were 100 times acceptable levels, then when that graph shows we are only 5-10 above normal, that spike looks quite small.

And the fires are ongoing. 

And the winds are peaking again. 

And cleanup hasn't begun (which further disperses particle).

And toxins don't just travel via the air. Soot and ash coat everything and recirculate on cars, sidewalks, streets, freeways. 

And the damage to the water system isn't being considered in all of this. 

Discounting any logical concern as emotional or counter productive because it causes massive anxiety is nonsense.

Anxiety is a wildly appropriate response to an ongoing life threatening event.

That aside, telling someone who is anxious to ""Just relax."" causes the opposite to happen.

So which camp is the right camp in this situation?

Neither. 

We just want to pick one because having any kind of certainty is also a core, fundamental human need.

The fact is we have no certainty.

"Yes, and the rain saturates the ground where buildings were burned to the ground that are full of heavy metals and carcinogens.

Those will be further dispersed as clean up crews get to work. If we assume they are very careful and conscientious, they are still unable to completely stop dispersion of contaminants. 

More likely, especially in this city with a bad track record of cutting corners (trying to work at an accelerated pace to clean up), safety won't be prioritized by all the crews. Cost and time will.

Then there is the matter of where all that toxic waste ends up. Again, disposed of properly, it travels across the freeway to a designated area. Disposed of improperly it ends up traveling across the city, without proper containment for its journey and ends up in some random ditch or river.

At any rate, rain makes a toxic slurry from the burned out cars and houses, which runs off downhill recontaminating streets, sideways and soil where some dries and can be redistricted by wind, cars, people.

It enters the sewage system or, if there is an overflow, directly to the ocean. 

Where I live, they have shut down waterlines because they have PVC drainpipes melted in all the destroyed houses which released benzene down the drains.

All the while downplaying lead (and asbestos) inhalation as negligible because it happened only once/for a short time, when we know from decades of research that this is pretty bad, and a one-time exposure is not nothing. Depending on the numbers this could make a difference. We only have one data point, which is not enough to make a decision either way. But the other person chose to assume that the existence of one data point must mean that there are no other data points since there is no more lead pollution - when I would argue that the lack of more data points could mean anything (more/less/same pollution). Pico Rivera may be very unique and the only place in L.A. where lead pollution spiked, which is coincidentally exactly the location where they decided to measure lead. I am not aware of that and believe it safe to assume that lead (and asbestos) pollution is widespread in L.A. and will not go away on its own, until the rain washes it into the oceans, and settles into the nooks and crannies of our backyards between the grass and lawn furniture and hammocks and sun sails, where it will affect us for years, if not decades to come.

Blaming climate change on this disaster is anti science drivel.

We know from the geological record that this exact climate has existed here for tens of thousands of years with periodic wildfires over and over and over. In fact if you take just the past 150 years of wildfires, put it on a map, and extrapolate you will clearly see that in only 500 years every single point in Southern California will have burned. That means that on average over 10,000 years every point in SoCal has burned 20 times.

It's also irrelevant. Only the most talentless, vision less, boring hack throws up their hands and says ""no more building"". You think the Japanese gave up after an earthquake or a fire took out a village or a shrine for the past two millenia? Hell no.

Reddit is truly unimaginative at the best of times. We have people in here with zero land management experience writing the most pointless, useless junk. Blaming not enough water while our reservoirs are topped off and full. Blaming blowers for bad air quality while not realizing those people are collecting dry leaves that can start a fire. They'll blame someone for ""wasting"" water while that person, out of their own pocket, is paying to maintain 10 acres of firebreak on their property with green and lush vegetation. 

You'll never legislate away a fire risk. Better men and women than you have tried.

And yet California is at the forefront of fighting climate change. We run the entire state for weeks off of renewable energy. Within 15 years I have no doubt it will be 100% of our entire grid. And it's all pointless. While we do good there's gigantic tankers of oil burning in Russia and the CO2 ppm goes on up and up.

"Well...eventually, a catastrophe so big will happen that people will stop denying it. This is a human nature thing to me. People do this on an individual basis all the time. They know something is wrong. Maybe it's a lump they found on their body. Or they smoke. Or they're having blood sugar problems. Or their knees are hurting. Something is changing in the body and needs to be attended to but most people fear change and will do anything to put it off. So we ignore the symptom of something wrong until we face a crisis too large to ignore.

  
As far as what that crisis is for humans collectively? This feels like one of those things maybe. This is a large and sophisticated city with a well-developed emergency management system. If you were here on the night of the winds when the fire started, you know there was no way to effectively stop a fire from spreading once it started. The conditions were bone dry and ready to explode and the winds were--well--those winds were a story unto themselves had they not been eclipsed by fire. 

  
The thing that's going to prevent people from raising the alarm en masse is our elected and unelected leaders that have a vested interest in *not* addressing climate change as an urgent issue. Because, like when a body gets cancer, the treatment is severe and requires a wholesale change in behavior and expectations. Let's say you're a politician who has constituents that are very change averse to the extent that you've used that lever to bind them to you by probing their fear of change. Or let's say you are a wealthy industrialist. Or an oil executive. Or any number of powerful people around the world. Changes to society that would be required to meet climate disruption in any useful way would likely be antithetical to your wealth and/or power. So you're going to spend a lot of energy and resources trying to kick that problem down the road.

If I may interject here.  I lived through the Woolsey fire and have been informing myself how to best take care of my property and neighbors for this fire risk and ember attacks.  

Something astonishing that I stumbled into is how our friends over in Australia handle these mega fires.  Yes they do not generally get Santa Ana type winds but the topography and proximity of urban areas to brush land is similar.

Their residents are far more informed about the many things they can do to harden their homes against ember attacks.   They take brush clearance extremely seriously, and any red flag days as well.  Eucalyptus trees are treated like deadly cans of fuel.  Look around on reddit, Aussies are mind blown about the amount of these tinder box trees that are lurking so close to urban areas.  Even worse is the lack of maintenance on them clearing them of ladder fuels.

There are so many things we can do in advance to lessen the impact and fuels these fires have to grow.

And when all of those thousands of sprinklers go off all at once while the fire department is opening hydrants? And worse, what happens if structures do burn and the pipes burst like they did in the Palisades and Altadena? Oh wait, we already know. The entire system loses pressure because it‚Äôs built for a few structure fires, not a Category 1 hurricane of dry air and fire. That‚Äôs how fast the wind speeds were. Category 1.

>and lets not require electrical lines to be underground

Have you actually looked into this? They can‚Äôt bury the high voltage supply lines.

>lets not invest in 24/7 monitoring systems such as drones and sensors.

This had nothing to do with detection (and they already have drones and surveillance, btw). The fire in Altadena took out the neighborhood within a few minutes. It was detected right away because everyone was on high alert. There‚Äôs even video of it starting and how fast it grew.

Water trucks can carry a portable meter with them and legally fill up at fire hydrants. Why should someone not be able to use a public utility they pay for? That water in swimming pools? It came from the same water lines that feed the fire hydrants. And maybe...just maybe...people on the ground with charged hoses who can put out small fires and embers before they turn into a neighborhood destroying inferno isn't exactly a bad thing....

Another reason Caruso used the water trucks, is they have onboard pumps, hoses, and nozzles. I heard he hired a bunch of out of work movie teamsters with water trucks to come help protect his property. What's wrong with that? I get the general hatred on here of people with money, but he also has a duty to his tenants, investors, lenders, and his insurance companies.

"*One particularly unique modern utilization of cisterns is found in San Francisco, which has historically been subject to devastating fires. As a precautionary measure, in 1850, funds were allocated to construct over 100 cisterns across the city to be utilized in case of fire. The city‚Äôs firefighting network, the Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) maintains a network of 177 independent underground water cisterns, with sizes varying from 75,000 US gallons (280,000 L) to over 200,000 US gallons (760,000 L) depending on location with a total storage capacity of over 11 million U.S. gallons (42 million liters) of water. These cisterns are easily spotted at street level with manholes labeled CISTERN S.F.F.D surrounded by red brick circles or rectangles. The cisterns are completely separate from the rest of the city‚Äôs water supply, ensuring that in the event of an earthquake, additional backup is available regardless of the condition of the city‚Äôs mainline water system.*

Regarding the seven-minute response time, I live in a very-high-fire zone with narrow streets, and a lot of people ignore the red-flag-day notices, so a full-size fire engine might struggle to get here (and a fire could happen on a non-red-flag day).

All that it does is get another hose connection point closer to their home.

That is going to cost alot more than $1300 described in this story. A rough estimate for a 100k gallon tank+pipes+pumps+private fire hydrant would be about $500,000. The folks who own 20+ million dollar homes should definately be looking to do this.",01-29-2025,0,0,0

the platforms have stale data, these reports don't distinguish between people taking a cursory look at the map and seeing much higher rents than before VS people looking at a specific listing that specifically raised their rent too much, and the prosecutors and journalists are just using the platforms taking cursory looks

the landlords and real estate agents may have their own data and ability to provide proof that fits into the regulations, OR NOT, and just looking at Zillow or some MLS won't tell you anything

and this is important if you actually look at the regulations, because units that weren't already listed for rent can charge almost anything, up to a separate \~$9500 limit created by the price gouging regulations. a number they probably wouldn't even try for, but have been inspired to by saying that number. and actual luxury properties can't list at all, because they already would rent above \~$9500, driving demand for the lower properties to actually rent out that high! how dumb!

"I mean the state + reallocation of tax dollars is the answer to all of that. Any land not owned or occupied by an individual - so the forest area that caught fire - would be considered for an X mile or yard or whatever distance deemed reasonable for safety. Tax dollars would be moved from one space to this one. The state would employ people to be groundskeepers much like they do at parks and trails. Standard order procedures for inspections and controlled maintenance put in place. 

For areas in which brush is a person's home property, it's not unheard of to have some form of maintenance or safety code requirements. Sprinkler systems, annual or semiannual (I don't know any real numbers I'm just vaguely spitballing an idea) grounds maintenance to keep vegetation beneath a certain threshold, would be required by the property owner (can't think of a better solution for this, I'd prefer it was still the state taking care of all of that but I understand how these things tend to go).

My husband is out fighting that fire tonight üôè,11-07-2024,0,0,0
"A ‚Äúdangerously fast‚Äù wildfire fanned by hurricane-strength winds was burning out of control near Los Angeles on Wednesday, with thousands of residents ordered to evacuate and some taken to the hospital.

Multiple large homes were destroyed as the fire tore through neighbourhoods, blanketing a huge area in thick smoke.

Fierce gusts up to 80 miles p/h (130 kilometres) were fuelling flames that were scorching through farmland.

The mountain fire was reported near Moorpark, 40 miles north-west of Los Angeles, on Wednesday morning.

By afternoon it had exploded to 10,400 acres (4,200 hectares), Ventura County Fire Department said, and flames had reached a suburb of Camarillo, home to around 70,000 people.

Local broadcasters showed luxury homes in the Camarillo Heights area engulfed in flames, many utterly destroyed.

Further up the hillsides, aerial footage showed people frantically loading horses into trailers at sprawling ranch properties as swirling flames loomed nearby.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad out there, but we‚Äôre getting them all out,‚Äù one woman told local broadcaster KTLA as she drove horses out of the area.

‚Äú(The fire) was surrounding on both sides... It‚Äôs just all over the place. It‚Äôs not one clear fire line. It‚Äôs everywhere.‚Äù

Firefighters had no official figures for the number of properties affected by the blaze, with conditions on the ground too dangerous to allow damage assessment.

There was no immediate figure for the number of people hurt, but officials said some had been taken to the hospital.

Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said the rapidly spreading blaze was entirely uncontained, with firefighters rushing to get people out of the way of the fire, which was casting embers as far as 2.5 miles (4 kilometres).

‚ÄúEvery helicopter, every fixed wing aircraft, everything we‚Äôve been able to get a hold of is here fighting this fire, and it is moving at a dangerous rate,‚Äù he told reporters.

‚ÄúBushes are burning, grass is burning, hedgerows are burning, agricultural fields are burning, and structures are burning.

‚ÄúThis fire is moving dangerously fast.‚Äù

"No.

The impact is localized. Most of the destruction has involved residential homes and retail businesses. It's not like Apple or GM burned down. And there wasn't any destruction to some key chip manufacturing site or rare Earth metals mining operation.

The site isn't long-term scarred. There's no radiation to deal with or massive landslides that have permanently altered the topography. There's no landmines to clear out or uniquely dangerous environmental hazards. Sure, it's not freshly graded green fields, but there's no major obstacles to new development.

The impacted region is (generally speaking compared to global measurements) wealthy. Many of the people impacted have powerful connections or are themselves powerful people. They will have above-average access to the capital necessary to move forward from this event.

For example; the man-on-the-street interviews have the crying family where the dad laments ""I just got my motorcycle back from being completely rebuilt and now it's been destroyed. We were only able to make it out with some family photos and a few pieces of art."" Or; ""My neighbor's main house burned down and their other house might burn down as well. And the other house isn't even finished yet, so they can't even move in there.""

Now look, these are certainly tragic situations, but crying about luxury motorcycles, art and second houses gives a glimpse as to the wealth these people have. I DO feel bad and they deserve sympathy and assistance, but they'll have access to capital when it's needed.

The event has high visibility which will help facilitate a lot of money being brought in from the State of California, The United States Federal Government, and perhaps even foreign governments. We're already seeing real, meaningful and costly support from Canada and Mexico.

It will be a great development opportunity. So much fresh land ready to be developed ""with a new vision"" AND with political support to ""streamline the rebuilding, cut through unnecessary red tape, and get this community back on it's feet"" (All things I've already heard during press conferences).

"They are, but the reinsurers are going to jack up their premiums as a result. Normally, this would get passed along to the consumer through price increases, however the P&C market is heavily regulated at the state level. The California DOI has historically not allowed insurers to raise rates even remotely close to where they need to be just for insurers to break even. Eventually the business model breaks and insurers stop doing business in the state as we have seen. That said, there is a part two. 

The real risk here is that most if not all carriers pull out completely from wildfire risk areas if not the state as a whole. This will push more people into the state-run Insurer of Last Resort pool. This pool is going to be extremely expensive compared to carrier rates as it‚Äôs essentially priced at the correct break-even rate. So with this being the only option you run two scenarios; first is unsustainable premiums that worsen the affordability crisis, and second; if disasters like this stack together in the state the CA Last Resort pool could in theory become insolvent due to losses outpacing claim reserves. This is unlikely as long as they price correctly but that would trigger an incredible crisis where lenders basically would also pull out of the CA real estate market.",01-12-2025,0,0,0

"2008 was a perfect storm and a tipping point -- it had very little to do with Katrina. In the 90's people were able to buy decent homes for a mortgage that was equivalent to a years worth of salary. Then in the early 2000's Bush passed a bunch of laws to make it easier for people to get into mortages, and homes started to be viewed as a way to create generational wealth for the general populations. It was insanely easy to get a mortgage. People were taking out home equity loans to buy luxury cars and stupid shit. Then there was also a lot of fraud with developers - they were getting people who couldn't afford a mortgage into one, and those people didn't have to put anything down.

Now, you have to put a sizable amount of money down. I just purchase in Los Angeles and had to put $200k. If I were to lose my home, I would NOT walk away because I have too much skin in the game. I'd imagine most people are in the same boat. It would be interesting to see what's next, but one would hope that California comes in and helps substantially.

Hope this helps!

"I have to disagree with that.  (Also the numbers I've seen put our population growth at twice our building rate, not four times, but that's quibbling).

The main issue blocking housing is political; that can change.

But also that assumes a historical (which is worse than constant even) rate of population growth, which is far from assured. (Indeed, our population dynamics are such that we should expect a population drop, as the baby-boomers start to decline, and subsequent generations have both lower birth rate and increased average parent age at child birth).

Note also that not all housing built has the same rate of negative rent pressure; it's not just how many people there are, but also how much those people are able to pay (or more accurately willing, but the two are strongly coordinated in times of shortage). Rents can only rise as high as the market will bear; the problem is that while the housing market is stratified, lower ""strata"" homes can still potentially serve those who would normally seek ""higher strata"", so if there is a lack of supply in the ""higher strata"", that excess market shifts downward, and often can afford to bear higher prices.",01-23-2025,0,0,0

She was without power for 5 days, broke her laptop during high wind, purchased a generator and 2 air purifyers, lost her groceries(she did not buy the generator day 1, as she was assured power would be on by 7p the day she inquired). The inspector saw the items, but my friend could not provide the receipts...explaining to the inspector that she only learned that she may be able to get help from me(again she is very young), but said she could get her card receipts and get them to the inspector later by upload to the disaster site. Meanwhile, the site updated yesterday, Jan 27th with $300 for miscellaneous and another section updated to show ""pending"" without a dollar amount. Today, Jan 28th, she had the $300 in her accounr and the ""pending"" other section changed to show $770. The $770 will be in her account tomorrow, Jan 29th. So, her total is $1,070.00. The inspector checked for ash, which my friend still had on her windows. My friend did not get money for her generator and air purifiers as she never got back to the inspector with the receipts. Said friend was glad to get anything at all.",01-28-2025,0,0,0

"I think you are right and that's kind of what I was thinking as well regarding the inspection, but you would think they would make the $770 payment quick & easy for EVERYONE.  While I did not have any damage, I was in a mandatory evacuation zone and they didn't ask for any proof of anything except occupancy.  So I uploaded my DL front & back, lease agreement, and my most recent utility bill.  They did initially send me a letter in the Correspondence tab called ""Request For Information/Documents"" which said they weren't able to approve some of my assistance right now, which I believe was because this was all basically the first day I submitted my application and I don't think they had time to review my proof of occupancy documents yet.  But the next day when my proof of occupancy documents wound up showing up in the portal under the Correspondence tab, they quickly approved the $770.  I also uploaded just a note that I typed up that I had to fill my gas tank, etc. during evacuation and didn't know if that counted as an expense they would cover.  I only applied for Miscellaneous expenses and nothing else, I answered all questions about my property as ""unknown"" since there were no options for ""no damage"" since my area was likely going to be safe from the Sunset fire at that time.

And those often stack. So if local zoning says 10 units per lot but the lot is both within X distance of a train station or high frequency bus stop, and is within an area defined as a high opportunity jobs zone (not sure if the jobs one is the exact wording state law uses but it's close enough for this example), you can build 15 units instead. 2.5 extra units for being by a transit station + 2.5 extra units for being in a high opportunity jobs zone.",01-25-2025,0,0,0

Yeah I think building denser housing next to dry brush filled hills is probably a bad idea.

There's about 5 bus stops that arent near freeways, all of them west of Lake Avenue. They are the only real places where density bonuses come into play. Lots of million to two million and up homes arent within a half mile of a bus stop in Altadena so they wouldnt get the full advantage of unlimited density boneses.",01-25-2025,0,0,0

"If Barger and Horvath were concerned about their constituents rebuilding, it would be one thing, but this is not what she's concerned about.

Altadena is especially famous for both its local building intransigence combined with massive lots with tiny houses. They also have some absolutely massive Victorian-style and Spanish-style mansions that have been destroyed and most likely will never be rebuilt. And if Barger and Horvath get their way, those lots will remain empty until someone builds a like-for-like copy of the original house (which isnt happening).

The State, for what its worth, isnt coming in and saying everyone has to build a 10 story apartment building on every lot.

"We have a lot of track record establishing that 10% is about as high as you can go before it starts to strangle new housing production.

In other words, the people displaced by fires will be in need of help for some time. At least a year, but likely more.

If you don't think that's worth paying $90k per inmate per year, then incarceration isn't serving its promised purpose, and so incarceration needs to be reformed so that the cost matches the benefit. If, for example, you want to charge inmates for rent and food because you think it's unfair that they get free room and board, then propose it. Good luck with that.

But none of that has anything to do with firefighting or compensation for firefighting. Firefighting is a service rendered by specialists, and those specialists should be paid commensurate with the services they render, whether they are incarcerated or not.

TL;DR: Don't characterize incarceration as ""free room and board."" That's fucked up.",01-14-2025,0,0,0

">Incarceration is a consequence of a person‚Äôs actions

Nope, it's a government service. You are paying for a government service to isolate and secure them in a prison. You can attach whatever moral judgments you want to it, but on a functional level, it is a transaction between the taxpayers and the government to provide a service.

If you no longer want to isolate them because you don't think the government service is providing the stated benefit to your satisfaction, then we can reform the carceral system to reduce costs, or abolish it entirely for a different system.

But that has nothing to do with the services the inmates themselves can provide as specialists. And firefighting is a specialty that deserves fair compensation. If you don't want them to be paid, then don't put them to work.

>They‚Äôre paying their debt to society for their offense against it.¬†

They are already paying for their ""debt to society"" by being isolated from it and having access to their loved ones limited, not to mention the lifelong consequences of being an ex-convict. Why would you muddy the waters by messing with other unrelated matters?

You are conflating incarceration with professional services. It's always a mistake to cross boundaries like that.

Unless you see a ""debt to society"" as being completely unpayable, I see zero reason why inmates should be given lower-than-market salaries if they are just as qualified at a given job and have access to the facilities and equipment they need to perform the job.",01-14-2025,0,0,0

It's not unreasonable to WANT to account for that, but it IS unreasonable to actually try to implement it practically. All you are doing is needlessly complicating the equation.

>They put themselves in that position, not us.

Did they?

Can you **honestly** say the justice system is, in fact, just and moral? I certainly can't. So why would I use ""morality"" as a justification for anything related to incarceration?

I can't. Making it purely transactional and functional clarifies the system for everyone. Trying to impose YOUR morality on it only muddies it.

>And we're paying to train them in this trade, skills they can use when they leave prison.

Yes, and?

Do you or do you NOT want prisoners to be rehabilitated? Or do you want to just throw them out into the street, lacking any kind of current employable skills, and hope they don't recidivate?

>So you want to a) pay for their shelter, food, etc b) pay to train them in how to be a firefighter, and c) pay them the same wage as someone who is paying for their own shelter/food/gear/training to be a firefighter? It's a ridiculous demand

You only think ridiculous because you have a punitive rather than rehabilitative mindset when it comes to incarceration.

You think prisoners should be punished for their mistakes. I think prisoners should be taught to be more productive. If they suffer from a mental illness, they should be treated. 

I see no value in punishment except as a means to facilitate rehabilitation.",01-14-2025,0,0,0

#FEMA SCAMS. 
Only apply for aid through official websites and channels like DisasterAssistance.gov.

#Apartment/Deposit Scams
Lots of displaced people are out there who will be preyed on by this filth. They'll post ads for apartments that aren't for rent and take your deposit.  When you show up, it's occupied. It's never been for rent. Do your best to scope the possible apartment IN PERSON, like show up and figure out what SPECIFIC unit is for rent. Do not rent sight-unseen if you can avoid it. Ask friends to help you visit potential places for you in-person if you can't do it yourself.

#Real Estate Durress Scams
Assholes are going to approach anyone with damage and claim to want to buy their homes from them. They're not going to offer you reasonable value, and many of the outfits operating in this space are shady AF. ASK A REAL ESTATE LAWYER AND A FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO REVIEW ANYTHING before you transfer or sell your property. These vultures use desperation and anxiety to fuck over victims of tragedies.

"Other lesser scams that I came across during Katrina/Rita... probably will pop up here as well 

* ""Instant Cash Advance on your Fire Insurance"" these scams go by a number of names. Basically, the scammer will CLAIM that they'll advance you money TODAY on your insurance claims so ""you dont have to wait"". The claim this scammer make is that they will give the homeowner money today, like $125,000 as a cashiers check, with promises of ""the balance"" in a few days.  They hand the mark paperwork, which will include a quitclaim, hand the mark a ""cashiers check,"" and walk off to file the quitclaim. With this scam, they'll usually present lots of paperwork, use insurance terms, really pushy and they usually target the elderly.

The check isn't real. The claims are fraudulent. But the legal work to unfuck this scam is going to be EXPENSIVE

* Hauling/Clearing scams- people claiming they'll haul away your burned house's debris, but then peacing out with your money

* RELIGIOUS SCAMS. Holy moly, these assholes are full of BALONEY. SOOOOO many religious organizations flood in after a major disaster. The Hare Krishnas and Sxientologists have BOTH been repeat offenders of stealing aid, and in some cases reselling it at a MARKUP....

IF YOU'RE RELIGIOUS, stick with donating to trusted organizations or volunteering. Not everyone with a cross on and a donation cup saying ""God Bless"" is a good person.",01-12-2025,0,0,0

Murdoch New Corp companies are running a full court press with the intent of setting the table that LA fires were only due to Democratic incompetence.  Not climate conditions, but democrats.

Lots of celebs are being used for the propaganda campaign. Here is one produced by Murdoch's Australian ""news"" company and being spread through the whole Murdoch empire of NY Post, Daily News, fox media.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfKWJuHcHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfKWJuHcHc)

Musk of course is using Twitter/x to heavily promote recall efforts a/g Newsom and Bass.  The goal of course is to ultimately flip CA red even if the recall fails, this is all about propaganda. The same way ""immigrants eat the dogs"" worked.

Why the push to flip CA state Gov position red?

It's important to understand this is bigger for Trump and Musk than just getting more votes for the GOP in the House of Reps.

CA has a great deal of natural resources waiting to be raped, er, sold to the highest bidder by Trump. Fed environmental restrictions and monitoring will undoubtably be cut under Trump but CA environmental regs and monitoring is usually stricter than Feds.

So get rid of the Dems running California will let the oligarchs do what they want. If they can't flip the CA legis but can control the Gov that would at least allow a Trumpie Gov to appoint Trumpie judgs in CA and Trumpie regulators to be appointed to various oversight commissions.

And what about the water?

The largest concentration of lithium deposits in the world lies under the California Salton Sea. Estimated worth at least half a TRILLION dollars. This lithium is critical to make car batteries for EVs like Teslas.

Once production gets a big green light, there likely isn't enough water from the Colorado river to handle extraction/production. That's where the whole ""California doesn't have enough water to water the Southern California forests"" BS comes in.

The water grab from Northern California isn't about fighting wildfires. Trump and Musk could give a damn about them. Or fire victims-except using them as pawns.  The water is for development and fracking and mining.

"This guy, his son, and a neighbor worked together (with the help of a few firefighters also), successfully so far, to save the six houses on their cul-de-sac along PCH from the flames. As noted partway down the article, that ""last house standing in Malibu"" that has been photographed a bit is about three houses west of this cul-de-sac and they ran over and threw some water on its porch at one point.

What awesome neighbors. I'm glad they were able to do it without dying. (Apparently their escape plan was to paddleboard into the ocean if necessary. It sounds like this guy had thought about this quite a bit.) At least the people in these surviving houses will have good neighbors to keep them company in the postapocalyptic landscape.

>Caruso described the effort, dubbed Steadfast LA, as a high-powered brain trust for local, state and federal governments as it undertakes the massive task of recovery after last month‚Äôs devastating series of wildfires. The group that includes Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos would propose solutions to the myriad obstacles to rebuilding ‚Äî and plans to publicly call out the government if its response is not moving swiftly enough.

>‚ÄúI do have a bit of a bully pulpit that I can use,‚Äù he said in an interview. ‚ÄúSo we want to work alongside them, support them, but if the agencies aren‚Äôt doing the right things or getting the job done, we‚Äôre going to hold them accountable publicly. That‚Äôs not a threat. It‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs so much pain and devastation going on here, urgency is really critically important.‚Äù

So no donations. Just a foundation to bully the government on these ""so-called solutions"". This man has only donated $5 million. Less than what the LA sports teams donated ($8 million).

>Perimeter, the company behind Phos-Chek, has advised in the past cleaning the powder off as soon as it is safe to do so.

>""The longer the retardant dries, the more difficult it is to remove completely,"" they cautioned.

>Warm water and mild detergent are effective in removing it from small surfaces, the company has said. For larger surfaces, pressure washers can be used.

>The exact formula of Phos-Chek is not public knowledge but the company has said in previous filings that the product is 80% water, 14% fertiliser-type salts, 6% colouring agents and corrosion inhibitors.

>As for its color, the company said it is ""a visual aid for pilots and firefighters alike."" After a few days of exposure to sunlight, the colour fades to earth tones, it said.

>The retardant is typically sprayed around a wildfire on vegetation and land that is fire-prone to stop the flames from spreading to that area.

>According to the US Forest Service, retardants ""slow the rate of spread by cooling and coating fuels, depleting the fire of oxygen, and slowing the rate of fuel combustion as the retardant's inorganic salts change how fuels burn.""

>The Forest Service told NPR that this year, it phased out the use of one type of Phos-Chek formula - Phos-Chek LC95 - in favour of another - MVP-Fx - saying that the latter is less toxic to wildlife.

>The Forest Service also has a mandatory ban in place on dropping fire retardant in sensitive environmental areas, like waterways and habitats of endangered species. There are exceptions to the ban, however, in cases ""when human life or public safety are threatened.""

The solution to the wildfire issue isn't to throw tantrums and cry and yell that everyone needs to live where you want them to. There's literally dozens of examples of Architecture and technology on the market to help protect houses from burning down.

LA's building codes evolve regularly, to the point where we have some of the most strict codes in the US. It's why it's expensive to build here.

SFH zoning stifles multifamily construction of condos and rental units. Do we need 72% of all areas to be zoned this way? Probably not! But if you have a growing family and need to balance cost/space... right now, distant suburbs in firey places is a more competitive option.

*If I had a magic wand* to disincentivize new movement toward fire prone areas, I would eliminate SFH zoning entirely. Incentivize the building of more duplex/triplexes/condos in places already zoned SFH, if the zoning itself can't entirely be done away with.

Right. 

Because CURRENTLY, almost ALL of LA's 800,000 rental housing units are crammed into just 24% of residential land, due to zoning. Of course people are crammed in and there's going to be social friction.

SFH zoning is a big part of why this is the case.

If you go south to Long Beach, they have A LOT of duplexes around areas like the traffic circle, downtown, the Peninsula, Shoreline Village. They're fitting more people per block in comfortable housing that's still relatively affordable.

"I'm not privvy to all the details of LAUSD's cyberattack but I know a lot more than the average person given that I am in IT, and in the cybersecurity space.

The overall data exfiltrated was close to nothing to what they house. They ramped up hiring more personnel dramatically afterwards looking for candidates with much stronger credentials and continue to do so.

Vice Society also made attacks on other orgs including UCLA which thwarted the attacks. There could be any number of reasons why any data was exfiltrated.

However, in working in this space for a number of years, all professionals including many seminars that have been led by CISA, FBI and NSA now pretty much state that it's not a matter of when but how much.

In consideration that K12 schools typically lag behind due to many reasons especially lack of personnel, training and budget for new tech, they are the highest and most vulnerable to cyberattacks. It is important that it takes all three components to be successful. Not just one.

From what I remember Carvalho blamed their ISP for the Miami-Dade network outage by throwing their ISP under the bus on TV which was false. That was a DDoS attack caused by a kid. There's more that I haven't looked into on this one. Not a fan of him for that one.",01-17-2025,0,0,0

"It's not environmentalists and conservation agencies who are responsible for the brush. It's nature and physics. 

Southern California evolved to burn. Some species of seeds will not open and germinate unless they've been through a fire. Then they grow back incredibly fast during a wet season and die or go dormant during the dry season. 

And we do clear a lot of vegetation and fuel and maintain fire breaks. But it's like painting the Golden Gate bridge. They start on one end and by the time they get to the other end, it's time to start it all over again. Given how quickly the brush grows, there will never be 'enough cleared, all done!'

"Yeah, I'm sorry, but that comment displays a real lack of understanding of the fires and the winds, as well as the land generally.  

We are not talking about a forrest with dead leaves and trees.  This is all shrub land that is living, albeit dry as a bone (pre-fire).  It holds the hillside together...you can't just get rid of it, nor does ""thinning it out"" do much of anything.  

And the type of fire breaks you are talking about would be massive.  We were dealing with winds that were 80-90 mph, and flames that were several stories high.  Keep in mind that they were legit worried about it jumping the 405 -- that is a 12 lane freeway (6 each direction) going through the sepulveda pass.  No fire break can prepare you for that, and ultimately the fuel for the fire was, in large part, people's homes.  

While there are things that could have been done to mitigate some of the damage, at the end of the day, when you combine :(1) 9 months of no rain; (2) record high winds; (3) extremly low humidity; and (4) ample man-made and natural (and needed) fuel, you are going to end up the apocolyptic scene we all saw last week.  Frankly, the amazing work of the firefighters kept, among other things, the entire Valley south of the blvd. from going up in flames -- and based on the video of how close the fire got to Mullholand, it was a close call.

It's preventative measure that also helps mitigate. This was a clear deflection by LAist, not a debunking. When you have a week to prepare for a wind event, you clear the brush and also use that time to identify the high risk areas and move resources closer. 

If you've lived in LA for over 20 years, you already thought this was being done every time because it usually was. We deserve a real answer as to why this didn't happen so we can prevent that mistake from ever happening again.

"> Saying that clearing brush wouldn't change anything is insulting to everyone that experienced a loss.

Oh, stop it. This wasn‚Äôt a matter of brush clearance and anyone who tells you it was is a liar, whether it‚Äôs because of malice or stupidity or both. I live in the foothills, I grew up in the foothills, and I‚Äôve had PulsePoint installed on my phone for 10 years now with alerts for vegetation fires that LAFD-Valley, LACFD3 or LACFD5 are dispatched to. Every single day I see how many brush fires are reported and then handled, in fire season and out.

This wasn‚Äôt normal. You can‚Äôt stop a Category 1 hurricane made of fire, you just can‚Äôt. *Everything* becomes fuel when it gets hot enough, and it had a 90mph+ bellows driving it. 

Someone linked this earlier and it‚Äôs worth watching (the timestamp is at 15:00).

"Does CA need more fuel reduction sure! The point however is that fuel reduction wasn‚Äôt the main issue or factor in spread here that first night. And your titanic analogy isn‚Äôt reeeally equivalent. It‚Äôs a little too black and white. Fuel reduction is an important piece but it doesn‚Äôt mean necessarily mean a house or life saved without other considering other factors (type of structure material, wind, location of fire origin, ability to access and deploy resources, terrain, accessibility for emergencies crews to arrive and residents to leave‚Ä¶etc). 

One of things I‚Äôve been thinking about it how hard it is to manage where the projects are or in this case what areas to target once they know a Santa Ana wind event is coming. Like this could have been in a ton of other foothill communities. I agree the city def needs to examine this after the fact and learn and adapt to be as much prepared as they can next time. 

Some other info after my week of digging around on these topics: Since 2019, CA has identified needs and areas to improve in maintenance and prevention. [Here‚Äôs](https://www.fire.ca.gov/what-we-do/natural-resource-management/fuels-reduction) the link to CalFire‚Äôs projects. They were in Eaton Canyon in November 2024 RIIIIGHT above where the fire possibly broke out clearing 10 acres. A resident/senior editor and host @ joelpollak on X said ‚ÄúI have personally witnessed brush clearance on the trails in the mountains where the fire began.‚Äù about the palisades fire. 

All this to say, seeing more and more ring cameras or other on the ground videos from Tuesday night are fucking terrifying and it makes it really hard to see how much brush clearance could have made a difference that first night. (From my non-expert personal opinion, it seems what was effective in saving a house was materials/building and if there were water hosing or sprinkler systems).

I get the outrage. And absolutely agree in its necessity as a preventative and think the city and state needs to continue being proactive.",01-14-2025,0,0,0
Moving forward in time from a week ago when high winds fanned the flames we came to the days of calm winds during which progress against the fires was made yet the fires continued to burn.

"I'm very disappointed that LAist is walking a fine line here and using an article to debunk misinformation while misconstruing things further.

Brush clearances and prep isn't only about the Palisades fire. It seems like they didn't do it anywhere this time. This needed to happen everywhere not just the Palisades.

Ya'll this is how things always were done. It's not about eliminating any possibility of a wild fire, it's about doing everything possible to mitigate and prepare so they don't burn down entire neighborhoods and cities. Clearing brush in the hills and/or citing people for not clearing the brush on their property is an essential function of the fire department when we know a wind event is coming. 

It's not misinformation or something that needs to be debunked. People have legit questions that are not coming from a political motivation. The areas that burned down are solid blue and full of progressives. Listen to them. They are pissed off and it's hard to fault them for wanting to know if something they've seen the fire department do for decades for the express purpose of mitigating wild fires didn't happen this time. Telling them this is something to be debunked in such a knifes edge way to put salt in the wound.",01-14-2025,0,0,0

"Hm, I agree with the general point (that LA *City* Fire needs permanent wildland hand crews), but I have a few gripes with how it's written.

It doesn't clarify until a bit later on the different jurisdictions, and even then not fully. LA *County* Fire has a whole slew of hand crews. As, obviously, does CalFire, which has jurisdiction over the whole state. Several times it references ""LA"" without specifying whether referencing LA City Fire or LA County Fire or colloqually just the general metropolitan area (usually LA City Fire, but still, sloppy writing).

I don't think it's unusual for a city FD to rely on larger fire jurisdictions (e.g. county, CalFire, or USFS) for hand crews, since most wildland tends to be in unincorporated areas. That said, given the large wildlands even within LA city administrative boundaries, particularly the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains, I generally do agree LA City should have at least a few permanent units. 

This weakness would've made no difference with the Palisades Fire. Everyone was on alert due to the extreme red flag warnings. LA County Fire had hand crews ready in Malibu, and CalFire was mobilized in preparation as well. Once the fire started, hand crews from LA County were on the scene, and within the day, tons of hand crews from various different fire agencies. (And just to be clear, this would have zero to do with the Eaton Fire, since that's out of LA city admin boundaries.)

(And calling the section detailing Palisades Fire ""Shorthanded"" seems entirely misleading considering they even detail how many hand crews were on the scene that day. Ultimately they had to pull back because of extreme winds making things dangerous, not lack of manpower.)

In general, its good that these recent fires are putting eyes on whether our fire fighting units are properly resourced. But what LA City needs hand crews for are going to be for days without major red flag warnings, where CalFire isn't necessarily pre-positioned in the area, and so they don't always have to rely on LA County Fire to help out on more ""minor"" brush fires within their jurisdiction. (Heavy caveat on minor not necessarily meaning any less dangerous. But just that any ""major"" wildfire, it's basically just a given that LA County [at the very least, if not also CalFire and/or USFS] will also be involved.)",01-18-2025,0,0,0

* Infrastructure solutions like underground cable systems to minimize wind-related fire risks, advanced land management techniques, modern water irrigation systems, and successful desalination projects in Israel and Saudi Arabia at scale.
* The potential to convert vast quantities of brine into useful resources, such as lithium batteries and desalinated water for drought-prone and high-risk areas.
* Learning from international models that showcase effective fire prevention methodologies, such as those implemented in Germany.

The current reality shows that community-level responses remain strong, while government-level preventive infrastructure lags behind. There is a persistent focus on reactive measures rather than proactive solutions.

What the wildfires says about City of L.A.‚Äôs failure of imagination,01-27-2025,0,0,0
"
Article: In October, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed¬†Executive Directive No. 9, which established a citywide capital infrastructure plan.

The directive was a breakthrough for Los Angeles and a demonstration of poor governance: Such capital plans ‚Äî which outline priorities and strategies for building infrastructure ‚Äî are commonplace in local governments. But Los Angeles, a peculiar island in the world of governance,¬†did not have one.

I mention Bass‚Äô directive not to exonerate from her current political crisis nor to take a side in the bitter battle over responsibility for this month‚Äôs fires.

Instead, I wish to emphasize that the big controversy over the fires‚Äô causes ‚Äî faulty hydrants, dry reservoirs, prepositioning of fire engines or lack of personnel ‚Äî is way too small. ¬†
Los Angeles, buffeted by disaster, needs to argue about a bigger challenge: How and whether the city government, after a half-century of shirking basic responsibilities, might start governing itself again.¬†
If L.A. decides to get serious, it will be starting near the bottom. The city, which includes Pacific Palisades, doesn‚Äôt have a comprehensive catalog of its infrastructure or a plan for maintaining it. It‚Äôs a city that tolerates three water main breaks a day and disintegrating streets. It‚Äôs a city with a backlog of sidewalk repairs that would take years to process.

Even worse, it‚Äôs a city that has all but given up on planning. In California, cities are required by law to make and update general plans, covering elements from conservation to public safety. But L.A.‚Äôs official planning documents are mostly out of date. Despite some recent updating work, the community plans ‚Äî which are part of the city‚Äôs land use plan ‚Äî date to the 1990s. A few city plans ‚Äî for facilities and infrastructure ‚Äî are more than 50 years old.

Planning is about imagining a future. A city that doesn‚Äôt plan is a city that doesn‚Äôt tap its collective imagination. And that‚Äôs the bitter irony behind these tragic fires. Los Angeles, a city world-famous for imagination, experienced a monumental failure of imagination.

I mean, how could a city that produced films of itself destroyed by so many unusual disasters ‚Äî tidal waves, ice storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, zombies, infections, sharknados and a 50-foot-tall woman ‚Äî not have been ready for an epic fire?

The lame excuses by Mayor Bass and Los Angeles fire officials ‚Äî that the fire that destroyed Pacific Palisades was faster and stronger than any they could fight ‚Äî are confessions of this failure. ¬†And they should have imagined this blaze ‚Äî more powerful fires had recently destroyed other parts of California. City fire Chief Kristin Cowley admitted on TV that larger fire emergencies ‚Äúdemand an expansion of our life-safety service capabilities.‚Äù

Why didn‚Äôt L.A. make plans equal to its challenges?

One answer is corruption. The real estate developers and public employee unions that dominate city governments don‚Äôt want to be constrained by plans; they prefer to use their power to negotiate special deals with elected officials. And elected officials like the freedom to make ad hoc decisions about developments in their own districts. This sort of decision-making often runs on a pay-to-play system. Those who have power or money get what they want. And the City Council members get donations or, worse, illegal favors. This is why federal prosecutors have spent recent years bringing charges against so many city officials.

Mayor Bass could have changed this system after she took office in 2022. She could have revamped the City Council, cleaned out the 1980s-style city bureaucracy or asked voters to rewrite the city charter, L.A.‚Äôs constitution. Instead, she offered up only minor changes to the charter in last year‚Äôs elections and emphasized collaboration within the existing system.",01-27-2025,0,0,0
"Blows mind we are the only major California city without infrastructure plan. Further blows my mind we did so bad pursuing Biden infrastructure laws grant monies when we actually had the chance.

"Its worth considering that the insurance companies knew the risk was too high and thats why they pulled out. That was an alarm bell and the city did nothing. They knew something we didnt.

Moving forward I think if insurance companies have information about untenable or extreme risk that would be helpful to the city they should be obliged by law to share it. This is because as they are a for profit company saving lives or property is not their concern. A law dictating they must share this data with the city would help save lives, property and potentially save the city from a national disaster of this scale in the future.",01-27-2025,0,0,0

But Mayor Bass posted her first warning on X about the wind storm on Monday, when she was already in Ghana. Her office did not send out a news release about fire risk until nearly 11 a.m. on Tuesday morning, after the blaze in Pacific Palisades had already broken out.

‚ÄúThere was zero preparation. There was zero thought here,‚Äù said Michael Gonzales, 47, whose home burned down in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy neighborhood that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. His family of five was camped out in a hotel in Santa Monica on Wednesday as they began figuring out where they will live. ""

"These fires offer a second chance to remake the Los Angeles city government. So far, the city isn‚Äôt seizing the opportunity. An insider of the current system ‚Äî developer Steve Soboroff ‚Äî is in charge of the fire recovery. Perhaps Bass, once the smoke has cleared, will build on October‚Äôs announcement of a capital investment plan and do something bolder. But she hasn‚Äôt demonstrated that sort of vision yet.

L.A. is a world-class place but without a world-class city government. And it has no plan to create one.

If the city won‚Äôt fix itself, state agencies might intervene ‚Äî by assuming some emergency responsibilities as the state government has done with law enforcement in¬†Oakland and Bakersfield. The state could also convene L.A. residents ‚Äî I‚Äôd suggest using citizens assemblies ‚Äî to create new plans for the city.

The state would be fully justified in such a takeover. Los Angeles ‚Äî unable to match state gains in employment and education ‚Äî has been a drag on California since the early 1990s recession. Poverty rates have soared in Los Angeles as they‚Äôve flattened or declined elsewhere.

L.A. wildfires shine spotlight on obscure firefighting charity,01-20-2025,0,0,0
"It wasn‚Äôt long after wildfires erupted across Southern California that donations began pouring into a small office near Dodger Stadium.

Leonardo DiCaprio wanted to give. So did the Dodgers, the Lakers, Netflix and a Las Vegas casino.

The object of their largesse was an obscure nonprofit called the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation which, for the better part of two decades, had quietly helped firefighters by raising funds for equipment ‚Äî often things as nominal as gloves and flashlights ‚Äî not covered in the city budget.

After years of averaging less than $3 million a year in donations, the group received about $20 million in a matter of days.

Money came so fast, in such large chunks, that foundation President Liz Lin could not be sure of the exact total during a recent interview. ‚ÄúAbsolutely overwhelming,‚Äù she said.

Now she and her staff are working the phones, looking for a supplier who can fill rush orders for hand tools, hydration packs and fire shelters ‚Äî silvery blankets that protect firefighters overrun by flames. They have received a request for hundreds of headlamps.

‚ÄúThere are just so many things they help with,‚Äù Delia Ibarra, former president of the civilian Los Angeles Fire Commission, said of the foundation. ‚ÄúTo me, they are gold.‚Äù

The fire department‚Äôs need for such generosity has become a subject of debate, pitting Mayor Karen Bass against billionaire Elon Musk, drawing the fire chief and other civic leaders into the fray.

As flames scorched thousands of acres in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, there were reports that Bass had cut the fire department‚Äôs budget by 2.7% for 2024-25.

In fact, when ongoing negotiations with the firefighters union concluded several months after that budget went into effect, an additional $53 million in salary raises and $58 million for new firetrucks were approved, increasing the operating budget by more than 7% compared with the prior fiscal year, according to city financial analysts.

 
Regardless, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley complained about not having enough money. Musk and Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong criticized city officials on social media. Lin and her foundation have tried to distance themselves from the controversy.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to get into the political nuances,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe just ask [the firefighters], ‚ÄòWhat do you need? Give me a cost.‚Äô ‚Äù

Her foundation dates back to 2010, when local business owners visited a station house that did not have a washing machine capable of cleaning the toxins from heavy turnout coats. They discovered the vast majority of the department‚Äôs budget goes to salaries, leaving a relatively minuscule amount for equipment and specialized training. Individual stations were holding pancake breakfasts to raise money.

Establishing itself as a 501(c)(3) organization, the new group signed an agreement with the city to become a recognized fundraiser and developed a process by which department leadership and stations could apply for help.

Donations totaled about $500,000 annually at first, enough to pay for computer equipment, some of those special washing machines and several thousand flashlights. If a station‚Äôs refrigerator broke down and the budget had no money for a new one, the foundation stepped in.

Firemen often ‚Äúhave to do repairs at the stations themselves,‚Äù Ibarra said. ‚ÄúSometimes they are fixing stuff out of their own pocket because it‚Äôs easier than putting in a request [to the city].‚Äù

By 2017, the foundation was attracting more than $1 million annually, a figure that would continue to grow. Lin took over from the previous president the following year, just before the Woolsey fire burned nearly 100,000 acres in L.A. and Ventura counties.

‚ÄúWoolsey was my training camp,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI had to understand the mechanics, the processes, what happens.‚Äù

When a 2020 explosion injured 11 firefighters, the department requested a $277,000 Thermite RS3 robot that could remotely explore engulfed buildings. Two years later, it needed to replace an aging helicopter.

The foundation, which raised almost $6 million that year, spent about half that amount for a new Bell 505. Other gifts have included specialized training courses, mental health services and veterinary care for search-and-rescue dogs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a process we never had before,‚Äù LAFD spokesperson Margaret Stewart, a 19-year veteran, said. ‚ÄúThose were needs that were not met.‚Äù

In the world of charities, where local organizations such as the J. Paul Getty Trust and the California Endowment have assets in the billions, the foundation remains comparatively modest. Its paid staff of five works from a rent-free office at the department‚Äôs Frank Hotchkin Memorial Training Center beside Chavez Ravine.

Charity Navigator, a watchdog organization, gives the group a four-star rating and reports that 93 cents of each $1 contribution goes to firefighters. This matters because a similar L.A. nonprofit devoted to county firefighters recently disbanded after facing allegations it had misused funds.

Ibarra said of the city foundation: ‚ÄúIf you give money to them, firefighters are going to get that money.‚Äù

Some quick thinking has now greatly expanded the pot. Soon after the Palisades fire broke out, Lin told her staff: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get something out on social media.‚Äù The money came rolling in.

In coming weeks, as the wildfires subside, she will meet with department leaders to discuss future purchases that might better prepare firefighters for the next emergency. Lin said: ‚ÄúWhen I walked down the hall this morning, leaving the operations center, I had four people stop me and say, ‚ÄòHey, what do you think of this? What do you think of that?‚Äô ‚Äù

With a department so large, serving a city so vast, the wish list seems never-ending.

Those heavy-duty washing machines, the ones that started all of this? The foundation has patiently bought a few at a time ‚Äî in between more-pressing needs ‚Äî working down the list of 106 stations. Fifteen years later, Lin says, there are 10 more to go.",01-20-2025,0,0,0

L.A. wildfires destroy Black community birthed from Civil Rights era in Altadena ,01-14-2025,0,0,0
"Article is kinda feel good click bait to be honest. It wasn't ""birthed"" from the Civil Rights era, it was one of the few suburban areas Black families were allowed to live in due to racist redlining all throughout LA county. [Black families who were already living in Pasadena, were forced out of Pasadena and into by local government officials](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c72eba7de6bd4c6aa63286e82963d0f8)

>But for thousands of Black Pasadena residents during the mid-20th century, the venerated stadium was something else entirely. The protection of the stadium and its natural surroundings became part of the City of Pasadena and state freeway planners‚Äô justification to upend Black neighborhoods. 

>In the 1950s and ‚Äò60s, planners and other local officials built upon decades of disinvestment, redlining, and urban renewal projects to push a new route of the Foothill Freeway/Interstate 210 through the northwest neighborhoods of Pasadena, resulting in the displacement of nearly 3,000 predominantly Black residents. An alternate route ‚Äî running largely through uninhabited parkland along the eastern edge of the Arroyo Seco valley by the Rose Bowl stadium parking lot ‚Äî was rejected.

>But as covenants and other blunt tools of racial oppression were ruled illegal, local officials turned to less overt but no less effective methods of displacement: neighborhood demolition and rebuilding projects best known as ‚Äúurban renewal.‚Äù These neighborhoods, fondly remembered by their residents, were labeled as blighted by the city in its 1962 General Plan. It was no coincidence that northwest Pasadena and other neighborhoods around it were the same that were ‚Äúredlined‚Äù by the federal mortgage evaluators HOLC in the 1930s. They were the neighborhoods where Black Pasadenans lived. 

>The city followed this same circular logic to determine the siting of the Foothill Freeway. After the planners and the local officials debated between a handful of alternatives, the ‚ÄúGreen route‚Äù ‚Äî which drove right through the neighborhoods with majority residents of color ‚Äî was ultimately selected because it fit best with the City‚Äôs General Plan. The General Plan, of course, was informed by the HOLC maps, which were themselves largely products of the racial make-up of the city at the time. It is hard to interpret this series of events as anything other than a coordinated effort by local officials over decades to displace Black residents.

"The fire log from that day from the LA Fire Department:

9:41 a.m. -- Mandeville Canyon fire erupts on Mulholland Drive.

10:20 a.m. -- Mandeville Canyon declared a major emergency.

10:40 a.m. -- The first of four brush fires begins in San Dimas.

10:59 a.m. -- Chino brush fire starts near Aerojet General, heads for Carbon Canyon in Orange County.

12:11 p.m. -- Agoura fire alarm.

12:38 p.m. -- Agoura is declared Level 1 (major emergency, fire management organization begins, ""war room"" procedures include expanded communications and support systems.)

12:47 p.m. -- Agua Dulce brush fire near Palatable.

1:34 p.m. -- Glendale fire.

1:57 p.m. -- Agoura declared Level 2 fire (maximum emergency, calling for everything available.)

2:30 p.m. -- Agoura-Malibu fire reaches the sea, 13 miles from start.

3:02 p.m. -- Brush fire starts north of Sierra Madre, heads up the San Gabriel Mountains.



This is an interesting read from the LA Fire Department Historical Archive if you want a accounting of just how intense that firestorm was:

"More from Didion:

>I recall James Taylor singing over and over on the news radio station between updates on the 1978 Mandeville and Kanan fires, both of which started on October 23rd of that year, and which could be seen burning toward each other‚Äîsystematically wiping out large parts of Malibu and Pacific Palisades‚Äîfrom an upstairs window of my house in Brentwood. It was said then that the Kanan fire was burning on a twenty-mile front and had already jumped the Pacific Coast Highway at Trancas Canyon. The stand in the Mandeville fire, it was said, would be made at Sunset Boulevard. I stood at the window and watched a house on a hill above Sunset implode, its oxygen sucked out by the force of the fire.

>Some thirty-four thousand acres of Los Angeles County burned that week in 1978. More than eighty thousand acres had burned in 1968. Close to a hundred and thirty thousand acres had burned in 1970. Seventy-four thousand and some had burned in 1975, sixty-some thousand would burn in 1979. Forty-six thousand would burn in 1980, forty-five thousand in 1982. In the hills behind Malibu, where the moist air off the Pacific makes the brush grow fast, it takes about twelve years before a burn is ready to burn again. Inland, where the manzanita and sumac and chamise that make up the native brush in Southern California grow more slowly (the wild mustard that turns the hills a translucent yellow after rain is not native but exotic, introduced in the nineteen-twenties in an effort to reseed burns), regrowth takes from fifteen to twenty years. Since 1919, when the county began keeping records of its fires, some areas have burned eight times.

>In other words, there is nothing unusual about fires in Los Angeles, which is, after all, a desert city with only two distinct seasons: one beginning in January and lasting three or four months, during which storms come in from the northern Pacific and it rains‚Äîoften an inch every two or three hours, and sometimes, in some places, an inch a minute‚Äîand one lasting eight or nine months, during which it burns, or gets ready to burn. What was unusual this year, after two years of drought and a third year of less than average rainfall, was that it was ready to burn while the June fogs still lay on the coastline. On the first of May, months earlier than ever before, the California Department of Forestry declared the start of the fire season and began hiring extra crews. By the last week in June, there had been more than two thousand brush and forest fires in California. Three hundred and twenty of them were burning that week alone.

If they are unknown, then detecting them could also be unknown, as well as their effects to the body, because no one has studied them because they were created in an uncontrolled fire with all kinds of hazardous ingredients.

">Beginning Monday, L.A. residents who live or work in areas affected by recent wildfires can apply for new food benefits through the CalFresh program.

**Who‚Äôs eligible?**¬†The benefits are available to individuals or families who are not current CalFresh recipients and who experienced lost income or disaster-related expenses due to the fires. Applicants must have lived or worked in one of the ZIP codes affected by the Eaton, Palisades, Hughes or Hurst fires as of Jan. 7.

These benefits may also be available to people who were previously ineligible for CalFresh, including college students, undocumented residents and unaided foster care children.

Check out full eligibility guidelines from¬†[L.A. County‚Äôs Department of Public Social Services](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food.html).

**What are the benefits?**¬†A family of four with a monthly income up to $3,529 may be eligible to receive $975 in temporary food assistance.

**Why now?**¬†The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved California‚Äôs request for CalFresh benefits to enhance fire recovery efforts ‚Äî one month after wildfires erupted in L.A. County.

**How to apply:**¬†The application period is open until Feb. 19.

You can apply via phone by calling (866) 488-8482 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. You can also apply in-person at any Department of Public Social Services¬†[office location](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/resources/offices.html)¬†between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.

>There are no state laws or regulations that mandate specific cleaning or testing before schools located near wildfires can reopen. Instead, schools must interpret guidance from multiple local, state and federal agencies and that information has not reached all parents.

**Frustrated families:**¬†Andrew Ferrone is the parent of two children who attend Canyon Charter Elementary School, a school in Santa Monica that remained closed as of Friday. ‚ÄúWe increasingly hear that the return to school is imminent,‚Äù Ferrone said. ‚ÄúBut we have very little visibility into exactly the protocols that have been taken and any level of assurance that our kids will be safe.‚Äù

**Limited guidelines:**¬†‚ÄúWhen to reoccupy a school is ultimately a local decision, made by the district and their respective public health department since each county may have different recommendations for air quality,‚Äù California Department of Education spokesman Scott Roark wrote in an email.

**The risk:**¬†The smoke and ash from wildfires create dangerous air quality, especially for sensitive groups that include children and pregnant people. Tiny particles can get into the lungs and cause health issues ranging from bronchitis to cancer. The fires can also release chemicals from plastics, lead, asbestos and other toxic substances.

**Best practices:**¬†All ash should be removed before students return to campus. Guidelines for cleaning include wiping down surfaces with mild detergents and vacuuming with machines equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.",01-27-2025,0,0,0

L.A. Wildfires Torched One of SoCal's Last Remaining Steelhead Streams,01-14-2025,0,0,0
"As first responders work to save human lives and property, fisheries managers are considering a potential rescue plan for the steelhead trout in Topanga Creek.

The Palisades Fire that has been burning for a week in Los Angeles County is only¬†14 percent contained¬†as of Tuesday, and¬†high winds in the forecast¬†could make matters worse. Officials are already expecting the blaze to rank¬†among the costliest wildfires¬†in U.S. history. And while human health and safety remain the top concerns, state fisheries managers are also warning that the fire could devastate the last known steelhead run in the Santa Monica mountains. Topanga Creek, which flows into the Pacific Ocean between Malibu and Los Angeles, contains the only remaining spawning habitat for steelhead trout in the Southern California mountain range. The small coastal creek has also been completely scorched over the last week.

While the streams of the Santa Monicas were historically rich in Pacific salmon and steelhead, a host of dams built during the 20th century cut off access to most of these river systems. Topanga is now the only creek in the area where rainbow trout can freely swim to the ocean and back. As such, it‚Äôs one of the last strongholds for Southern California steelhead trout, a unique and increasingly rare subspecies of steelhead¬†that was listed as endangered¬†in 2024.",01-14-2025,0,0,0
Plastic Is Making LA's Wildfires Even Worse - The Atlantic,01-15-2025,0,0,0

r/NoShitSherlock,01-15-2025,0,0,0
"Key Points from the article

	1.	Increasing Use of Plastics in Urban Development
	‚Ä¢	Modern homes and buildings rely heavily on plastic materials, such as polyester fabrics, polyurethane foam, and vinyl flooring.
	‚Ä¢	These synthetic materials are cheaper and more efficient but significantly increase fire hazards.
	2.	Fire Behavior with Plastic Materials
	‚Ä¢	Fires involving plastic burn hotter and spread faster compared to those with natural materials.
	‚Ä¢	In tests, rooms with plastic-based furnishings reached flashover (when a fire becomes uncontrollable) in under five minutes, compared to over 30 minutes for natural materials.
	3.	Toxic Emissions from Plastic Fires
	‚Ä¢	When burning, plastics release highly toxic gases, including:
	‚Ä¢	Hydrogen cyanide: A deadly gas that impairs oxygen delivery in the body.
	‚Ä¢	Hydrochloric acid: A respiratory irritant that damages the lungs.
	‚Ä¢	Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): Harmful chemicals contributing to indoor air pollution.
	4.	Health Risks from Smoke Inhalation
	‚Ä¢	The smoke from plastic fires contains fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into the lungs.
	‚Ä¢	Exposure to these pollutants is linked to:
	‚Ä¢	Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive impairments.
	‚Ä¢	Risks to pregnant women, including low birth weight and preterm birth.
	5.	Challenges for Urban Areas Like Los Angeles
	‚Ä¢	Densely populated cities with heavy use of synthetic materials face greater risks of devastating fires.
	‚Ä¢	The rapid fire spread and toxic smoke hinder firefighting efforts and threaten both firefighters and residents.
	6.	Broader Implications
	‚Ä¢	As cities become more reliant on plastic materials, the risks of urban fires grow.
	‚Ä¢	Greater public awareness and consideration of fire-resistant, natural alternatives are critical for reducing hazards.",01-16-2025,0,0,0

[OUR WEBSITE] Topanga Canyon Boulevard is closing until this evening amid wildfire warnings. Here's why,12-18-2024,0,0,0
">Topanga Canyon Boulevard is¬†[closed](https://x.com/CaltransDist7/status/1868817999937126647)¬†until 6 p.m. Wednesday, with only residents and local businesses allowed to travel through. Officials say it‚Äôs because if a wildfire did break out in the area, it would be difficult to evacuate the roughly 8,000 residents through the two-lane, high-traffic commuter route.

**Why it's closed:**¬†Jennifer Seetoo, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department captain of the Malibu/Lost Hills Station, told LAist that the closure may be inconvenient for those who rely on the road, but it could save lives when we have ‚Äúhellacious‚Äù winds that may cast embers miles in front of a fire.

‚ÄúOne major road in and out of Topanga ‚Äî we want to make sure that we keep it residents only to make sure that we can evacuate as \[fast\] as we can,‚Äù she said.

**The backstory:**¬†These preparedness closures are new ‚Äî it became a best practice after the devastating 2018 Woolsey Fire.

Kevin McGowan, the director of L.A. County‚Äôs Office of Emergency Management, told LAist part of the fire‚Äôs after-action response was identifying high-risk areas that have a larger population, just like Topanga Canyon. He added that officials don‚Äôt take these decisions lightly.

‚Äú‚ÄäFires move with more severity, and more speed, and they have caused worse outcomes than we've seen in those years past,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo the response in this¬†[preparedness](https://ready.lacounty.gov/)¬†phase had to change to meet that moment.‚Äù

**What's next:**¬†The closures come during red flag warnings, which Seetoo said we see approximately nine days out of the year. If wet weather arrives, we could also see closures for flooding or landslides.",12-18-2024,0,0,0
