"The constant lawsuits from ~~Turd~~ Bob Ferguson seem to have been super helpful.

I am aware that the Washington constitution lists ""sue the Trump administration at least monthly"" as a required duty of the AG, but maybe we could have the next one concentrate more on protecting Washingtonians (though not their gun rights) instead of poking the president incessantly.

Bonus: petulant presidents won't have cause to punish (unjustified or not) Washington for the actions of obsessed state officers.

Loggers need to clear their brush , but it takes a State or Federal employee to make sure. 
Than ..we have longer and dryer summers lately.

Now they want to sell the Federal lands to the corporations with no interest loans according to Trump.
Without regulations ..your clear ing of brush and rotten old fuel ..isn't going to happen.

**Federal workers across the PNW are being fired by the Trump administration. They warn of impacts on wildfires, science and historic landmarks**

By Alexandra Duggan

The Spokesman-Review

> The letter from the federal government arrived in an email Thursday. He was fired.

> First came a wave of panic. Then came feelings of betrayal.

> ‚ÄúHow could they be so callous?‚Äù his wife, Suzanne Anderson, asked. ‚ÄúLike we aren‚Äôt people? His name is just text on a spreadsheet. We are not people to them.‚Äù

> Dennis is 61, lives in Moscow and works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture studying plants on the rolling hills of the Palouse. He declined to share his last name for fear of retaliation from the same government officials who fired him. The whirlwind of emotions from being fired, as part of President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to slash federal spending by terminating large portions of the workforce, left him feeling too disjointed to articulate his feelings Saturday.

> So Anderson spoke for him.

> ‚ÄúNext week is his last paycheck. We don‚Äôt have healthcare. It‚Äôs not easy to get another job,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe love the Palouse ‚Ä¶ We raised our family here. We wanted to retire here. Are we going to have to leave?‚Äù

> Dennis‚Äô letter ‚Äì the same letter that thousands of employees in the federal government received Thursday ‚Äì told him something Anderson could only describe as ‚Äúa total lie.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,‚Äù the letter said. ‚ÄúFor this reason, the Agency informs you that the Agency is removing you from your position.‚Äù

> [Layoffs are happening throughout the federal government](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/feb/14/forest-service-among-agencies-hit-by-mass-layoffs/), with large cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Interior Department and others. The New York Times reported that the layoffs targeted most of an estimated 200,000 workers who were on probation, a period of time in which employees are easier to remove. Probation is required of all federal employees who enter a new position within the government, and it is not an indicator of poor performance or wrongful behavior.

> As of Saturday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has fired around 3,400 employees, according to a news release from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. This includes the loss 1,400 U.S. Forest Service employees, said Matthew Brossard, vice president of the Forest Service Council. More terminations are expected in the coming days.

> Brossard is working to tabulate the numbers of employees who have been let go, but the numbers are ‚Äúhard to comprehend,‚Äù he said. The gap left from these workers, often workers the public takes for granted, will be significant, Brossard warned.

> Dennis was on probation as a new plant scientist for the USDA. He has felt like he was going to be on the chopping block for a while now ‚Äì before his termination, he was getting signals that he and other employees were barred from speaking to the press.

> While his letter told him his termination was based on his performance, nothing about Dennis‚Äô work indicated he was underperforming. His boss is even trying to fight his termination, Anderson said. He‚Äôs also not eligible for unemployment because his firing was ‚Äúperformance-based.‚Äù 

> The hills of the Palouse are covered with wheat, lentils and other food crops. It‚Äôs home to some of the highest-yielding dryland wheat fields in the world with farmers often harvesting 100 bushels or more per acre. Dennis‚Äô job is to continue researching those crops ‚Äì how they grow, how they flourish and how drastic changes in weather or droughts can affect a farmers‚Äô harvest.

> The government can rely on that research to communicate with farmers about crop production, Anderson said. Farmers are also given open invitations to tour with the researchers, and the two groups tend to learn from each other.

> ‚ÄúThe science and the research is important to get what they need. It comes down to economics. Changes in the environment change crops and can change the soil. Researchers have to look at those things. The wheat farmers, especially,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey need the researchers. We are all tied together in Washington and Idaho. It‚Äôs not just the wheat, it‚Äôs all the crops. It‚Äôs vital for food.‚Äù

> So does the administration know how vital the Palouse‚Äôs crop production is to the world? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Anderson said: ‚ÄúThe manner in which these firings were executed, they clearly didn‚Äôt do their research.‚Äù 

> Since the notice, the government has declined to say how many workers have been laid off in the states of Washington and Idaho.

> ‚ÄúSecretary Rollins fully supports President Trump‚Äôs directive to optimize government operations, eliminate inefficiencies, and strengthen USDA‚Äôs ability to better serve American farmers, ranchers, loggers and the agriculture community. We have a solemn responsibility to be good stewards of Americans‚Äô hard-earned taxpayer dollars and to ensure that every dollar is being spent as effectively as possible to serve the people, not the bureaucracy,‚Äù an email from a USDA spokesperson said. ‚ÄúAs part of this effort, USDA has released individuals in their probationary period of employment. We are confident that talented individuals who have been affected by this change will have many opportunities to contribute to our economy and society in countless ways outside of government.‚Äù

> Across the state of Washington lives Anna Coburn, 31. Every day in her work as a lead park ranger, she walks the trails on the north side of Mount St. Helens, which erupted in the summer of 1980, claiming the lives of 57 people.

> ‚ÄúI love people,‚Äù Coburn said. ‚ÄúAnd I love the planet.‚Äù

> Like Dennis, Coburn received the same form-letter email on Thursday, which told her she, along with other colleagues at her station, were terminated from the job she had spent three college degrees and many years trying to obtain. Coburn‚Äôs father died last year, and the feeling of grief that swept over her was palpable. The grief of losing the job she loved feels like its on the same spectrum, she said Saturday. 

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as big as that, but it‚Äôs the helplessness and grief I feel, especially for everyone who have worked so hard to get where they are. You have to work hard in the federal service to make nothing. You have to pay your dues,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow I have to start at square one. This job market is not prepared for this.‚Äù

> The volcano that made national news draws visitors from around the world. It‚Äôs an epicenter for ecological studies, a dream location for park rangers and an optimal destination for tourists. Coburn looks to the volcano as a scientific revelation and its rippling impact across the United States, especially one that took so many lives.

> ‚ÄúBecause of that, people are motivated to go around the globe in the science community and help local agencies do better work, evacuations and disaster response. It changed the world in so many ways,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have people from all over the planet come because they are so excited about what Mount St. Helens means to the world. It‚Äôs so important to have (us) up there, not only for those who lost their lives, but the people who remember it.‚Äù

"*[Part 2 of 2]*

> **Impacts on wildfire response will be consequential, workers warn**

> The Trump administration promised wildland firefighters they would be safe from termination. But that pledge doesn‚Äôt apply to those who are the second line of defense during wildfire season.

> ‚ÄúI received a notice of an employee‚Äôs termination who is on a fire assignment in Louisiana,‚Äù Brossard said. ‚ÄúThey were let go. And they don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre getting home at this point. The (Trump) administration doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know about that.‚Äù

> When wildfires ignite, firefighters head straight to the flames with their axes and hard hats while helicopters zoom overhead. As they do the work, they look to other workers for support - dispatchers, mechanics or forest protection planners. Public information officers take information from those people and distribute it to help reach people and keep them safe.

> Those positions were among the positions gutted this week, Brossard said. 

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have this huge gap going into fire season of a critical position to inform the public what is going on on their lands,‚Äù Brossard said. ‚ÄúIn the Forest Service, there are office positions for fires. [There are extra dispatchers. There is ground support. They‚Äôre all being let go](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jul/27/when-the-fire-bell-rings-heres-how-teams-quickly-m/). Everything in the Forest Service is going to be affected. They‚Äôre going after the support people, the people who do all the work on these incidents, it‚Äôs all going to be limited.‚Äù

> Riva Duncan has spent more than 30 years in the Forest Service responding to wildfires. After her retirement in 2020, she became the vice president of the nonprofit, Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. The organization is meant to address concerns raised by wildland firefighters, like healthcare, pay or workers compensation claims.

> ‚ÄúA vast majority of people let go is non-fire. But what the public needs to know, is they still fight fire,‚Äù Duncan said. ‚ÄúThat might not be their full-time job, but everybody helps. They fill in on engines, hand crews, helicopters, and provide a ton of behind the scenes support, like logistics, food, water, planning and more. There is a giant group of people behind the scenes supporting fire, and firefighters cannot do those jobs without them.‚Äù

> Duncan now lives in North Carolina, but she spent several of her years working in Oregon, where wildfires tend to rage every summer. She has also spent time fighting fires near Spokane. Duncan knows all too well the importance of wildfire response in areas like Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, because those are areas with evergreen forests, tall trees and dry soil.

> ‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs a lightning storm in the PNW, which happens every summer, there are numerous fires at once. It‚Äôs an all-hands-on-deck thing,‚Äù Duncan said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to affect response times. Some of these people fill in when people are sick or on leave. This will have far-reaching effects, and the public needs to be concerned.‚Äù

> Because those areas are so rural, many of the federal workers in those small towns have nowhere else to seek work once they are let go, Duncan said. And when they leave, they‚Äôll bring their spouse with them. Those spouses may work in sectors like school teaching, so fleeing the town with their spouse who was just fired will also leave the town with one less teacher.

> ‚ÄúThe people who answer the phone to sell permits or to tell you if a recreation site is open, a lot of those folks were fired, too,‚Äù Duncan said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to have a ripple effect, it will affect a lot more people than those folks who were fired.‚Äù

> While workers like Coburn are finding it hard to rationalize the reality of being fired, she knows too many people take her position for granted. Rangers are there to teach people the history of the ground they stand on, to direct them toward pleasure or to warn them of danger. Losing an entire lead team at Mount St. Helens is detrimental to those who want to experience the same joy of the volcano that Coburn does, she said.

> ‚ÄúPark rangers keep your parks open ‚Ä¶ We clean your bathrooms. We keep the trails groomed. We are in your visitor‚Äôs centers. We are keeping the public safe when they‚Äôre enjoying the land,‚Äù Coburn said.

> Too often, tourists arrive at the mountain who are not equipped for a long hike. Some don‚Äôt pack enough food or water and some don‚Äôt read the signs or maps. Some get lost and have to be rescued. There‚Äôs too many instances to count where a life has been saved by a park ranger, Coburn said.

> ‚ÄúI regularly help people who have fallen, or who are suffering,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe had a lady come from the cruise ship ‚Ä¶ Last year she fell and busted her head open. We were so far up the road, and we are far from medical. I was there to help command the scene and hold her head closed for an hour.‚Äù

> Park rangers teach, bring people water or patrol the trails, Coburn says, but first and foremost, they are there to help. Now that she has no position to go back to, she has no idea what‚Äôs next.

> Neither do Dennis and his wife. The two are trying to stay calm in a quickly-changing environment.

> While both consider themselves fortunate for what they already have ‚Äì a home that is paid off and no extra mouths to feed ‚Äì Anderson says she‚Äôs worried about the younger federal workers who are beginning to have children and have to find a new source of income at the drop of a hat. 

> ‚ÄúMy heart goes out to people who don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be able to put food on the table,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúImagine being told you‚Äôre terminated, but now you have to fight for unemployment. They‚Äôre trying to wear people down.‚Äù

> Coburn has sent her resume to every place she can think of ‚Äì she‚Äôs tried the Washington parks department, a department she‚Äôs pretty confident has a ‚Äústack‚Äù of resumes after the mass layoffs. She also even applied for a job at Home Depot to find a source of income until she lands back in her chosen field.

> Everything she‚Äôs worked for since she left Mount St. Helens the first time to get her master‚Äôs degree feels gone, she says. Like she‚Äôs starting at square one.

> ‚ÄúBeing told to leave because I‚Äôm not fit for the public is absolutely insulting,‚Äù Coburn said. ‚ÄúI was very proud of the role I had this past season, and it meant a lot to me.‚Äù

"**Washington wildfire prevention, Spokane County fire relief among funding frozen by Trump order**


By Alexandra Duggan

The Spokesman-Review

> A Tuesday order from President Donald Trump that froze federal funding to assess diversity programs and organizations that don‚Äôt adhere to his plans also froze funding for integral wildfire prevention programs around Washington.

> Trump‚Äôs order freezing significant portions of federal spending pending a review by his administration was halted temporarily by a judge, but the order raised many questions around wildfire and disaster relief programs supported with federal money.

> Among the frozen funds included millions to help communities recover from devastating wildfires on the West Plains and in northern Spokane County in 2023. Still, some local officials are waiting to take any action because the announcement is so recent that future ramifications aren‚Äôt exactly clear.

> Additionally, the Washington Department of Natural Resources, a state-run agency that aids in fighting and preventing wildfires, spent much of Tuesday examining how the federal funding freeze would impact their wildfire prevention grants.

> ‚ÄúWe went from waking up to the news that we may be losing $100 million to prevent and respond to wildfires to getting random guidance saying that a freeze probably doesn‚Äôt apply to wildfire work to a court throwing the brakes on the whole thing,‚Äù said DNR spokesperson Ryan Rodruck in an email. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre looking at every federal dollar this agency receives to get a better sense of what might be impacted. Yes, a court has stopped this for now, but we don‚Äôt want to be caught off-guard again in two weeks.‚Äù

> The Trump Administration alerted agencies Monday evening, with little to no notice, that federal grants would be frozen following a review to ensure those agencies were adhering to the government‚Äôs priorities. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget claims federal funding projects on the chopping block are limited to ‚Äúending DEI, the green new deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest.‚Äù

> The freeze was blocked and delayed until Feb. 3 by a federal judge Tuesday. But the parameters still appear vague in scope for when the freeze could resume.

> The order originally affected the $44 million federal assistance approved by Congress and former President Joe Biden to aid in the rebuilding of areas around Medical Lake and Elk destroyed by the Oregon Road and Gray fires , according to Medical Lake Mayor Terri Cooper. The county received the grant, aimed towards housing development, infrastructure restoration, economic support and fire resiliency, earlier this month.

> Medical Lake City Administrator Sonny Weathers said because the freeze was meant to review legitimacy, he is hopeful the government will see the value in the town‚Äôs disaster relief grants.

> ‚ÄúThere could be some delays, but at this point, the work we are engaged in is mostly about that resilience effort. Recovery is ongoing and we wont rest until we have gotten everybody comfortably back and restored,‚Äù Weathers said.

> The town also is waiting on a hazard mitigation grant program for backup power generators, awarded from FEMA. That agreement has not been finalized, Weathers said.

>DNR, one agency that received the Trump Administration‚Äôs notice, is ‚Äúconcerned that it could impact pass-through recipients of Community Wildfire Defense Grants,‚Äù according to an email from the department‚Äôs spokesperson, Ryan Rodruck. The agency is also ‚Äúgetting a grasp‚Äù on potential impacts that federal funding cuts could have on the people of Washington, he said, but the status is in limbo.

> ‚ÄúWith no foresight and no warning about this morning‚Äôs order from (the Office of Management and Budget), we just don‚Äôt know right now,‚Äù Rodruck wrote.

> In the meantime, scrambling to understand what lies in the future, DNR plans to work with grant recipients to ensure communities are able to reduce the hazards of wildfire.

> ‚ÄúSimilarly, we‚Äôll continue to look at other DNR programs that receive federal funding, such as our efforts to ensure wildfire prevention information is accessible to people who do not speak English as their first language and our urban and community forestry program, which tailors grants to underserved and underrepresented communities,‚Äù the email said.

> According to DNR, it receives multiple federal grants totaling around $105 million. Those grants include fire management assistant grants that protect communities from fire and reimburse state disaster accounts. They are waiting on $45 million to $50 million as part of this grant, Rodruck‚Äôs email said.

> Other grants revolve around volunteer fire departments, keeping track of landslide areas, post fire debris flow preparedness and recovery, tsunami hazards and mitigation actions like evacuation planning and fuel reduction.

> The Spokane‚Äôs Fire Department also does extensive work planning and preparing forests for the potential of more devastating wildfires. The city utilizes a Community Wildfire Defense Grant for $1.5 million, which goes toward wildfire fuels reduction, said the fire department‚Äôs Wildland Resource Planner, Nick Jeffries.

> Jeffries remained clear that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know anything yet‚Äù about the freeze or what would happen once it restarts, but if the grant was classified as wasteful spending and cut following the Trump Administration‚Äôs review assessment, ‚Äúit would have a huge impact,‚Äù Jeffries said.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs critical to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are fitting forests to make the fire less intense when it comes.‚Äù

> The city is working to minimize the impact of fire on about 400 acres under the Community Wildfire Defense Grant. If that were to be on the chopping block, ‚Äúthen you‚Äôd lose out on a lot more,‚Äù Jeffries said.

> The pausing and unpausing of the the disaster relief money for the 2023 Oregon Road and Gray fires in Spokane County could delay the grant process further because there are certain milestones, like data assessment and community feedback, that the county must hit before cashing the check in its entirety.

> Spokane County Commissioner Al French said during the freezing and review process, the county ‚Äúwill answer any questions‚Äù and address any issues raised by the government ‚Äúto get access to the grant money originally given to the county.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early in the process. But we will go through the process,‚Äù French said.

> President Donald Trump has withheld wildfire funding from Washington before. In 2021, he prevented the town of Malden from receiving federal dollars to rebuild after a fire swept through the town. The reason, [according to previous Spokesman-Review reporting](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/jan/16/trump-is-blocking-aid-to-malden-pine-city-fire-vic/), was due to his animosity towards Washington‚Äôs former governor, Jay Inslee.",01-29-2025,22,Spokane,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

"Jason Stanley cites an affinity for conspiracy theories as a component of fascism. For a time, it was hyperbole to use that word. Now its use is appropriate. 

One could view the Weimar economy as the unfortunate culmination of postwar sanctions, political instability and a global economic downturn. The ‚Äòstabbed in the back‚Äô narrative was easier to grasp and more appealing to wide swathes of the population. The common people sought answers and the nascent fascist regime needed an out group to serve as a unified opponent (See Robert Paxton‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnatomy of Fascism‚Äù p. 219 or p. 41).

Climate change could be understood as the consequence of industrial pollution, fossil fuel refinement and combustion, the environmental burden of consumer culture and a global military empire that poisons air and water supplies on the same scale. To acknowledge this, the average Western citizen would need to overcome a lifetime of propaganda and conditioning. It‚Äôs far easier to fault a shadowy cabal of globalists (inevitably translated or reduced to Jews). The extreme right in this country, in the service of energy interests and an ever intensifying authoritarian arc, stands ready with bellows in hand, prepared to fan the flames of antisemitism and bigotry.

">Jason Stanley cites an affinity for conspiracy theories as a component of fascism

I think it's about building a narrative, and it's easy to use conspiracy theories to do that, because human belief is powerful for narrative.  Conspiracy theories are fun, and sometimes turn out to be right, however if you don't have the mental acuity to be skeptical, then you end up with the Q stickers on your car.

It's more, conspiracy without the theory.  All you need is post or video posting an inflammatory rumor that ""might"" be true.  Trump famously used, ""...a lot of people are saying..."" it's the same thing.

"Yeah i read what they‚Äôre saying. But that‚Äôs the hang up I have. How does shutting off the power in a fire risk area actually prevent a fire? The fire risk is always going to be determined by wind, dry conditions, and high temperatures. So are they just going to start shutting off the power in areas when it gets hot, dry, and windy? And then turn it back on once it rains or the wind stops? That could be days! 

The reason I suspect there‚Äôs more to this than is being said is that they actually alluded to the idea of balancing demand when they talked about the risk to healthcare services in the event of a power outage during a catastrophic fire. And they mention the need to make sure that the medical facilities maintain power when the fire risk is high. 

Hot and dry conditions also create an increase demand on the grid. And that increased demand can damage the grid. So they don‚Äôt want a weakened grid during fire season. That makes sense.

Blackouts do not have to be grid wide, and more commonly are used in small targeted areas as needed. It is also a really well proven method that works and is used pretty frequently for weather events across the industry. 

The trick is balancing the risk of fires with the demand for electricity. All utilities have numerous processes for monitoring weather and high risk weather events. If anything, utilities have a tendency to be extremely conservative when leveraging any sort of black out type event.

Yes, they are talking about hot, dry, and windy weather, but it‚Äôs important to note that there is a science behind these fire risk assessments. Think of blackouts being another tool that can be used when needed, and one no utility likes to use. When they have been utilized by other utilities, it is generally days with very extreme risk of wildfires.",05-09-2024,26,Spokane,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,False

Focus on the MERV rating of the filter. I‚Äôve found 2 filters, front and back of the fan, restricted air flow too much and needed the fan running full-power which was too loud to live with. 

The tape/cord attaching the filter to the fan can even be skipped if you are aren‚Äôt worried about children or animals as the fan intake will hold the filter as long as the fan is running.

**Wildfire smoke increased death rate in Spokane compared to statewide metric, says new state report**

By Amanda Sullender/The Spokesman-Review

Wildfire smoke is lowering life expectancy in Spokane and across Washington, according to a new report by the Washington Department of Ecology.

Focusing on air pollution of all kinds, the report highlights 16 communities across the state that are ‚Äúoverburdened‚Äù by air pollution and have a higher death rate as a result. Using data from 2016 to 2020, the report found those in these communities, including Spokane, live an average 2.4 years less than Washington as a whole.

Accounting for 15.5% of Washington‚Äôs population, those in the overburdened communities have more health problems than the state as whole, especially lung and heart disease.

While the report details the effects of many air pollutants, the largest contributor to the pollution in Spokane is fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke. These particulates are smaller than 2.5 micrometers, which is 30 times smaller than a strand of hair, and can penetrate deeper in the lungs and in the bloodstream than larger particulates.

The report estimates 65 deaths occur each year among adults in Spokane and Spokane Valley that are associated with the fine particulate air pollution largely derived from wildfire smoke.

From 2020 to 2022, Spokane had an average of 7.3 days with unhealthy air quality, compared to 6.7 days in the state as a whole.

According to the report, the presence of long-term exposure to air pollution of this kind can cause asthma development in children and chronic cardiovascular conditions in adults. Short-term exposure can exacerbate asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and increase the risk of heart attack or a stroke.

Besides wildfire, other sources of these fine particulates in Spokane include residential wood burning, vehicles, trucks, trains and dust from construction and agriculture. Since wildfire smoke is typically seasonal, the biggest cause of particulates in the winter is smoke from home heating.

Because Spokane is surrounded by forests, the report anticipates ‚Äúlonger fire and smoke seasons in the decades ahead as the region becomes drier and warmer‚Äù because of climate change.

The inaugural report is mandated by the state Climate Commitment Act and will be updated every two years after a Department of Ecology review.

‚ÄúThe findings in this report underscore the importance of the strong air quality and environmental justice provision contained in the Climate Commitment Act,‚Äù Department of Ecology director Laura Watson said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Climate Commitment Act not only decreases harmful greenhouse gas emissions but also takes concrete steps to reduce air pollution that unfairly impacts the most vulnerable people in our state.‚Äù

Those who live in Spokane or the other 15 communities can participate in a Department of Ecology survey.

The 16 overburdened communities in the report include:

‚Ä¢ Spokane and Spokane Valley

‚Ä¢ Ellensburg

‚Ä¢ Everett

‚Ä¢ George and West Grant County

‚Ä¢ South King County

‚Ä¢ Mattawa

‚Ä¢ Moxee Valley

‚Ä¢ Northeast Puyallup

‚Ä¢ North Seattle and Shoreline

"People who bitch about others crapping all over their addictions aren't coming from a place of perfection, but from our own experiences more often than not.

Being someone who smoked for a year in college, drank regularly with practically everyone else during my WSU undergrad years I never have had a problem walking away from either.

The one corollary that people ignore is health, both for myself and those around; and health that is both physical and psychological as factors.

Now, moving forward in life one also brings in the socio-economic factors that both habits produce, and once again it is health.

This time it isn't just that both addictions are damaging to my physical and psychological well-being, never mind those around me with varying degrees of separation [degrees of freedom in engineering terms], but with economic factors that we all share as we get older.

These ``screw you you sanctimonious SOB'' retorts are the ravings of an insecure person who can't seem to recognize that their choices are screwing it up financially for everyone.

When you have to take care of an aging parent with dialysis who used to smoke, but never drank, and who only became a diabetic post the age of sixty you are welcomed to the world of ``Raping America for all it's Health Care Riches'' via DaVita and it's only other option in this country.

The answer isn't, ``let's get fifty dialysis corporations to reduce the price'' fantasy land of our early twenties that Milton Friedman and the Austrian School of Economics has always ejaculated as the solution--a flacid fallacy is more accurate--when in truth those said fifty corporations will rise all their levels to match their competitors and instead of a duopoly you now have fifty oligarchs stiffing the nation till it's dry.

Until we put caps on medical services and supplies we will continue to see people go bankrupt on a consistent basis. Those bankruptcies go directly to the national debt which like all corporate debt becomes long term debt.

Instead of solutions to addictions that are killing us, this nation is promoting solutions to mitigate and medicate our addictions, thus making the average person deemed a long-term asset for these corporations.

An inordinately large number of people are too unwilling to invest more in healthy foods that require foresight and effort to build into consistent eating habits for the convenience of right now.

Those addictions are killing the planet. 

The RISK analysis associated with large scale disasters is outweighing any potential for insured liability.

You combined addictions with narcissism and a deviance to either be too lazy to put out your cigarettes and just toss them, or secretly just have desire to spit at the world for something you feel it owes you, either way it's costing us all on all fronts.

Get a smokeless pipe already and get into a program to get off of nicotene. Your addictions whether fueled by a lit cigarette or more addictive smokeless pipe seems to not this group from ever finding a habit that isn't costing us all in the long run.

No one gives a rat's ass about your ``perceived slights'' for being a self-absorbed prick. Do something about it and keep doing something about it. 

Those that love you will thank you for your changes and you will too. There are no dogmatic indoctrinations necessary, no obnoxious 12 step crap, just your own initiatives to make changes in your life.

One tip I will note, I have never known anyone who has either a nicotene, alcohol or other narcotic substance abuse problem and later became successful not recognize the people around them then were a huge contributing factor of remaining an addict.

I'll take my actual experience over what your ""class room education"" says any day. You're being filled with propaganda instead of actual education. Proper forest management includes thinning over population and removing dead/diseased trees. I'm sorry but you're completely wrong and missing the point. California is a prime example of deadly fires that could've been prevented by proper forest management. [Even Yellowstone learned that lesson.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_fires_of_1988)

I'm going to give you a break down of the circumstances. Until the late 1960's fire attacks were done by direct attack. Then since then until now, they are done by setting perimeters, back burning and very little direct attacks because it helps forest management. Even native Americans did this thousands of years before we got here. Fires aren't growing in size but they are getting deadlier because we are living closer to these forests and we aren't doing any preventative forest management. You're a student and you need to pay attention to these facts. Don't come to me trying to come off as an expert when I was out fighting fires when you were likely still shitting your pants.

>It is well known fact within the scientific community that logging industry is full of bullshit lies, directed at getting the public to support more deforestation.

No it isn't and you need to STFU when you can't discern the difference between thinning, clear cutting and now deforestation.

"Believe it or not, once a fire starts that is the most effective way to put them out. We use equipment where we can, but many areas are so remote it wouldn‚Äôt be feasible to airdrop equipment there, aside from what is already in use. We do use drones for infrared imaging to detect hotspots and fire patterns, but as far as drones to drop retardant we‚Äôre a long ways away from that. 

The best way to prevent fire depends on the land you‚Äôre on. If it‚Äôs desert/grassy then you want you regularly burn the land so the fuel doesn‚Äôt overgrow. For forests, we want to first, thin the forests of small undergrowth and leave big trees, then burn the remaining undergrowth and repeat this forever. Currently, firefighters are the resource available to do this task, but with most firefighters being seasonal, and our actual time on fires is ever increasing, we are falling behind on this task. 

If more money was given to firefighters to hire crews exclusively for mitigating fuels, and if government crews weren‚Äôt bound to purchasing equipment through the government from contractors, we could get a lot more done. But, fire doesn‚Äôt make any money like war, so it‚Äôs not exactly a priority at this point.

>>Hello! If you are reading this, you have probably committed an atrocity! Assuming that you are using Windows XP, it is a (mostly) stable operating system that is still used past its ""expiration date."" However, like many of the other stock programs that Microsoft ships with their OS, Windows Paint is not always the best choice when editing images to be posted on the internet. Much of the original quality of images can be lost when exporting directly from Windows Paint. It can still be avoided, however, by exporting/saving your image as a .PNG, and NOT a JPEG. This rule may not apply to Windows Vista or 7 as far as I know. Also not sure about Macs or Unix OSes.

"If you read through the article, it gives multiple reasons:

\-Lots of homes + trailers that have been owned by a family for many years, they are all payed off so no bank is involved that would require insurance.

\-General poverty, so insurance is hard to afford

\-Insurance rates in these areas are often much higher due to distance from other infrastructure like fire departments, lack of fire hydrants, poor quality/minimal roads for access, etc. 

\-Some insurance companies in certain areas have been cancelling coverage because those areas are hit by fires so often it is too high of a risk for them. 

\-Manufactured homes (like trailers and doublewides) are apparently much harder to get insurance for.

\-The land is not owned by the people that live on it, it's some sort of complicated federal land trust situation.

"On a personal level, this exact thing basically wrecked my life in the early 2000's.   I worked at a outdoors job daily for several years.  One year, the Idaho field burning was particularly bad and I worked in heavy smoke for around a month's time.  I developed a weird sinus issue that included a lot of drainage, vertigo, and fatigue.  I still deal with it daily.  The only time I've had a time free of it was when I had a culture done and used targeted oral and nasal antibiotics.  That lasted approx. a year, then the condition returned.  The stuff I have to do to manage it is crazy, and the health problems due to the smoke conditions we have are no joke.",02-03-2021,70,Spokane,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,False
