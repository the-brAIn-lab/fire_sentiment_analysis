            "You are still wrong sir, yes the population was less but the industrial nature of the region was much more polluting as well as the cars and as you mentioned the wood burning for domestic heat.  Here is an excerpt from a NY times article dated 11/6/83 talking about the push to ban wood stoves in the Western US:\n\n\u201cIt is here in Missoula that the problem of residential wood smoke is probably worst. ''In the early 70's, the culprits were the pulp and plywood mills,'' said Elaine Bild, director of Missoula County's Environmental Health Department. ''When the E.P.A. forced industry to cut emissions, we saw a decrease in the air quality problem, but after 1975, after the fuel crisis and when people started buying wood burning devices, it began rising.''\n\nToday at least half the homes in the Missoula Valley heat with wood. On winter days when cold air is trapped in the valley by warm air at higher elevations, in atmospheric inversions, this city of 63,000 people nearly disappears under a blanket of wood smoke. The smoke blots out the mountains and sends people with respiratory problems to hospitals. Street lights come on. Survey Finds Children Affected\u201d\n\nWe still have the same geography so we still have the same issues with pollution.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/us/western-states-consider-curbs-on-wood-stoves.html",

            "The air quality report is spot on. We are in the confluence of 5 different valleys in a region that consistently has summer wildfires. So if there is fire in any direction the smoke gets funneled into the valley and sits in the old glacial lake bed. I've lived here about 12 years and can only remember about 2 or 3 summers that didn't end with consistent amounts of smoke until snow started falling. So it isn't so much temporary as it is seasonal.\n\nBack in the 70s and 80s when Missoula had more heavy industry and no wood/coal burning bans they used to refer to it as Fort Stinkpot.

It is now basically all year.\n- population influx outgrew the infrastructure years ago\n- proliferation of obnoxious \u201cnon denominational Christian\u201d churches who are happy to tell you to repent your dirty homosexual sins, but they still \u201clove\u201d you\n- their State representatives waste time discriminating against trans kids, trying to ban books, and are scared of drag queens which somehow also means that Social Emotional Learning in school is antifa propaganda(?????yeah I don\u2019t know)\n- meth, opioids, and sooo so many drunk driving fatalities (basically zero public transportation and lots of long distances to get home from the bar)\n\nTo be fair, Kalispell and the surrounding areas have been attracting white nationalists who hoard weapons for decades.

There are some amazing people there, but, it\u2019s red. You\u2019ll encounter people very far right and then some. \n\nMissoula is a 2 hour or less drive from Kalispell and other locations as well, Coeur d\u2019Alene, Helena, Butte, Great Falls. The people in Missoula are weird, but that\u2019s the heart of it. One day I\u2019ll buy my home there. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: also, make sure to start taking vitamin D.

            "I meant outdoors stuff, but there's more indoors, too. For instance, there is the insectarium at the Fairgrounds with a new exhibition garden outside; both are great places to take kids. First Fridays downtown. Caras Park. The Missoula Children's Theater is world famous (find the documentary \"Little Red Truck\"). Our new library just won international acclaim; in Kalispell, they're about ready to shut down their library, because it opens minds, you know, and there needs to be some control over that ;)\n\nMissoula has walking trails that are stroller and wheelchair friendly. There are bicycle routes throughout Missoula, including old rails-to-trails. Heck, you can bicycle all the way down to Lolo on a bike trail. There is the standing wave (Brennan's Wave) downtown in the Clark Fork River, to surf, kayak and paddleboard. One island is a designated dog park. Missoula is a lot more dog-friendly.\n\nOne thing I miss from the Flathead is having convenient lakes (Missoula has a lot of rivers and creeks = \"Five Valleys\"). You can leave work in the Flathead and go to any of a dozen small lakes that don't allow boats, or trailer your boat to work and leave from there, and be on a lake in 15 minutes-1 hour. And it has lots of dirt roads that weren't heavily traveled. I would take my sled dogs in my truck to work and run the team after work, and try to be off the trail by dark.\n\nMissoula is a bit busy off the beaten track, but thankfully, still not anything like the Denver area, where you can't even find a parking space at most trailheads.\n\nIf you are into camping, there are more places to camp that are convenient to Kalispell or Whitefish, so you can camp during the week and still commute to work. That's not something I would want to do in the Missoula area.\n\nReally, it just depends on what you are looking for.",
            "From your post it sounds like you're moving from a larger metro area, take the term international flair very very lightly. Compared to elsewhere in montana, there's an international flair, but not compared to a bigger city, we moved back to Denver and there's nit a single restaurant in Missoula that I miss enough to return to Missoula for. The drivers in missoula are horrible be prepared to go atleast 5 under everywhere and be cut off pretty regularly while driving. Don't miss Missoula at all.",

            "AQI is a qualitative measure of air pollutants based on how they affect human health. There are a number of pollutants that can have an impact on human health, and they each have different levels where they are normal, unhealthy, etc. Moreover, gases are measured in ppm (moles of pollutant per million moles of air), and solid particulates are measured in particulate weight per volume of air (\u03bcg/m^3 ). \n\nTo simplify the information, each pollutant is assigned an AQI of 100 for the concentration of that pollutant that is acceptable but borderline unhealthy for sensitive groups, and the rest of the scale is assigned accordingly for each pollutant.  The highest value at any given time is then the overall AQI.\n\nDEQ is only measuring solid particulate matter, in weight per volume. \n\nHope this helps.",

I also didn\u2019t enjoy hiking w a constant fear of grizzlies; had a few encounters.  It\u2019s crowded and expensive where I live now, but I find the people and politics much more friendly, kind, laid back and welcoming compared to Montana. I\u2019d say the same for Colorado. If I were you, I\u2019d check out Colorado or Washington. If you are set on Montana, then I\u2019d recommend Whitefish, Bozeman, Livingston or Missoula.

            "What city do you live in Arizona? We\u2019re new to Billings, and as someone who lived in PHX, I\u2019d suggest Billings if you\u2019re looking for something big. Well, \u201cbig\u201d in Montana terms\ud83d\ude02\n\nI find the city to be wonderful. We looked on the western part of the state and not even Missoula has what I need for a temporary stay in a \u201cbig city.\u201d We lack in a few areas: not many food options open 24 hrs, or food places open past 8, movie theaters have THREE showings a day (probably staffing), sort of limited grocery options if you\u2019re not a Costco or Sam\u2019s member (Winco and Alby\u2019s), limited shopping (if you\u2019re in Phoenix, ghetto ass Desert Sky was bigger than the mall we have here now). We are also hours from major cities. Bozeman won\u2019t serve a full weekend\u2019s needs if you\u2019re looking for \u201cbig\u201d once in awhile. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nHome prices are cheaper if you\u2019re looking to buy, we may not have a lot of late-night food options. But, we have A LOT of food options, you WILL NOT have to use the freeway for anything (I haven\u2019t used the freeway since I exited with the moving truck Aug 6th), wonderful and friendly people, and something is ALWAYS happening as far as events during these warm months. Lastly, I think Billings is very family-friendly. There\u2019s a lot to do outdoors, or the many weekend events we have. From the fair, to a sustainability event, to a gun show. There\u2019s something for a family outing. \n\nWeather-wise, it\u2019s colder a bit earlier than I\u2019m used\nTo. It was 91 yesterday in Salt Lake, where we from. I think we hit\u2026 60-something (?)\u2026 in Billings. It\u2019s gon\u2019 get cold. \n\nWell, that\u2019s my experience with Billings. I can see how people get depressed out here. You have work lined up so you won\u2019t have to deal with these low wages. I feel this town has lots of potential, and will be something in a few years. They\u2019re building new homes in the southern part of the city. If people keep moving here, perhaps things will improve for the city and us living here. More interesting people, more things to do, etc. If you\u2019ve been noticing Laveen, AZ that town has become something since 2009. We still have a house we rent out out there, and it\u2019s crazy the growth they\u2019ve seen since 09. It\u2019a become a much more tolerable and fun town. I can see that happening here. \n\nSorry this is very long. But, hopefully it helps. \n\nPS: your neighbors might not talk to you after they see those out-of-state plates. Only our out-of-state neighbors have talk to us \ud83d\ude02 People are friendly, but not EVERYONE is friendly",
            "My advice is if you wanna move here don't move to billings you wanna get away then find a small town to start over in",
            "Congrats on your decision but be prepared. \n\nWinter weather months in many spots in Montana will require your kids playing inside for many days due to windchill. See that all over our neighborhood in Helena. Kids only playing outside for short time then inside the rest of the day. \n\nThe summer in Helena dragged on this year, had record setting number of days over 90 degrees. While the wildfires weren\u2019t too bad in Helena this year, so we could open windows in early morning to cool off the house. There were a couple days we couldn\u2019t go outside due to poor air quality. Last summer the air quality was horrible in Helena due to wildfires. Next summer fire season might be worse. Which means really poor air quality in Helena valley. Poor air quality means everyone stays inside. \n\nWhile many things are cheaper\u2026 food isn\u2019t. Health care access and medication is more expensive. Car insurance was cheaper but car registration was more. Housing costs are crazy high right now. The rental market and purchase market are crazy. Rentals are hard to find. As prices for homes rise so do property taxes. Check that your medical plan from your job will provide care in the part of Montana you are looking at. \n\nWhile you are bringing your job depending on your living location and situation, Montana internet the provider we use, wasn\u2019t able to connect us for a couple months. Hard to work from home without internet. \n\nWages in Montana haven\u2019t kept up with rise in housing costs and inflation. Out of state people bringing their out of state paychecks get blamed for rising housing costs. \n\nThere is crime, poverty, homelessness and drug and alcoholism in Montana. The large number of traffic deaths is sad. The likelihood of having an accident in Montana is higher per capita than in many other states. \n\nBest thing is be prepared. Have more money on hand than you think you need. Know you may come across people that blame you for the situation that is occurring when they see your out of state license plate. Some things will be trade offs. While your kids can\u2019t play outside in summer that may be true in Montana too due to air quality from fires or in winter due to severe cold temps.",

But, you make the best of it. Invest in cold weather clothing, you'll need it. Consider studded tires for your cars, they come in handy on the lesser travelled roads. Enjoy yourselves and the city. \n\nThe summers aren't bad at all, we hit 100+ a few times, but it's tolerable. \n\nI imagine that most of the \"Negative Nancy's\" have never been out of MT or to big, overcrowded, garbage cities.

Billings is well-below my speed, but doable. \n\nIf you\u2019re considering Billings, I can put you in touch with our realtor and his wife. They were so helpful since we basically bought the house sight-unseen, and online. If you\u2019re looking for something picturesque and still affordable (I think these locations are affordable compared to cities I\u2019ve lived), you\u2019ll get the pretty mountains from Bozeman on west. I saw some building going on in Three Forks. Three years ago, there wasn\u2019t shit\nGoing on out there when we visited for a kayak trip. Three Forks is very slow-paces. \n\nSo, you have options. Check out the \u201cMove to Montana\u201d Facebook group. Minus the bitter gatekeepers, you\u2019ll find lots of helpful people, and even realtors there.",

You previously asked why people don\u2019t leave Montana if they\u2019re not happy here. People ARE leaving Montana in droves, but you also are underestimating how low wages are here. It\u2019s kinda tone deaf to tell people making 45k (if they\u2019re lucky) to just move. Not everyone can just save up 50k like you have.

When we'd gone up, the firefighters paid us no mind, they were standing around casually. I asked if we were ok to go on up and they just nodded. When it all started blowing up, that casualness was gone and they were right on our heels. Fire was coming up the side of the road. It was incredible. I've never done a faster 15 mph in my life. I've never seen anything like it. Sun like a crimson ball, the snowfields up high were glinting blood red, and lower down when we got to McDonald Lake, it was like molten metals, copper and steel and gold, sparkling in the water.

            "I have lived in Whitefish my whole life, and I sincerely thank you for communicating so effectively the situation in the valley right now. There are extreme employee shortages in pretty much every service industry - including retail, restaurants and tourism. Many places that would normally be open 7 days a week (esp during tourist season) have had to close their doors on certain days, or shorten their regular hours. There are crazy long wait times for restaurants and lines and crowds for most activities. Locals are frustrated, burned out, and pretty over it and tourists often don't understand the severity of the situation or the reason behind the unusual circumstances. \nIf you're planning on visiting, bring your patience and some laid-back energy. And don't get too frustrated if the wait is long or your outdoor plans get canceled due to weather/smoke.",

Many in Butte are either closed certain days or restricting hours of operation. \n\nI live here for a lot of reasons and the scenery is one.

Smoke, heat, no views, understaffed businesses, recreation closures...it's really the opposite of a vacation right now.",

I saw that fire when it started.",
            "I wanted to walk out of my waiting job Thursday because the restaurant I work for is to cheap to have two people working the diner during the weekdays. Between the increased fire personnel, tourists, and regulars all of my tables were packed for 8 hours straight. The cooks were overwhelmed in the kitchen, the tables didn\u2019t understand why it was taking so long. They didn\u2019t realize every time the phone rang more food orders were coming in. When I drove into Missoula today there were so many RVs and campers with out of state plates. At this point the only visitors I want to see in the area are the fire personnel coming in from out of state.  Now really is not the time go be site seeing around western Montana. Especially people coming in on highway 12 from Idaho. The less traffic there is through that corridor will give the firefighters less obstacles to work around. People driving through the area can get in the way if the Lolo creek fire jumps containment lines down to the highway. No one here wants a repeat of the Lolo Peak fire in 2017, give the firefighters space to work. Take your vacation somewhere else.",

            ">We both work remotely\n\nMontana ranks last in the nation for broadband connectivity and bandwidth. Only 14% have fiber access. If broadband is important to your telecommuting plan, move with caution. (https://broadbandnow.com/report/us-states-internet-coverage-speed-2018/)",
            "> And don\u2019t worry about us driving up real estate prices because our remote jobs aren\u2019t based in California!\n\nHouse prices are already insane and will probably be a massive increase in col from Kentucky.\n\n> but still want decent amenities where we can easily drive to them.\n\nMontana is suburban hell, and you'd probably be much better off living on the outskirts of Cincinnati (unless you wanna commute an hour and half into town that turns into 2+ hours in the winter on the most dangerous roads in the country).  The larger cities in Montana are just big enough for large big box stores to come in and kill local variety, and there's usually one 'type' of store per city, so you have a hundred thousand people going to the same store for the same exact thing.  Where I live now on the outskirts of Pittsburgh I have so many options. Closest McDonalds is way too busy? I go two miles down the road to one that's dead.  Too much traffic? I have seven ways of bypassing it entirely.\n\n>Secondarily, how much has the increased smoke and risk of fire changed your life?\n\nFire danger and decent internet access seem to be mutually exclusive and smoke can be bad for a couple of months.  However with the incoming governor I wouldn't be surprised if that changes and forest management is completely neglected.",
            "To answer your question, yes I\u2019d move. Because people like you are ruining our housing and it\u2019s becoming unaffordable. You think you have to be from California to help fuck up our real estate issues? The time of growing up here and being able to buy a home is over",
            "I'm sort of in the opposite situation. I'm a 3rd generation Montanan. I grew up in MT, but was forced to move away after college because I couldn't find a well paying career or affordable housing.  My whole family still lives in MT, and I'm now in a well paying career that may transition to remote capacity some time in the next few years. I would move back in a heartbeat.\n\nYou'll get some salty responses on here, and rightfully so. Going back generations, Montanans are a proud bunch of people, and very skeptical of outsiders in general.\n\nTo answer your question,  the smoke isn't that consistently bad. Maybe off and on through July and August,  and a few severe smoke days mixed in over those months.",
            "I\u2019m a wildland firefighter here and also work in forestry management/wildfire mitigation. \n\nBest way to answer this: completely depends whether you have health issues and where you move. If you have lung problems like COPD or asthma...you might have some issues. Certain areas of the state are much more fire prone than others. \n\nWith all that being said, wildfires happen all over the state in varying sizes and forms. Montana is definitely unique that it experiences multiple different fuel model wildfires...everything from quick spreading grass fires in flat land on the east side of the state to dense timber fires in steep, mountainous terrain in places like central and western Montana....and everything in between that.\n\nSo do catastrophic fires happen here? Yes, sometimes every fire season. Some fire seasons are better than others with less acres burned. When there are very active fire seasons...expect the broad valleys to be socked in with smoke and the air quality index (AQI) to be well over normal levels of 100.\n\nNo matter where you move, expect there to be wildfires and also expect for wildfire mitigation burns like prescribed burns/pile burning. This will also affect air quality but help to reduce future catastrophic wildfires in the region.\n\nI would recommend looking at some of the average AQI numbers for some of the areas you\u2019re looking at purchasing a home in. This will give you a general idea of what the air quality is like throughout the summer. Even if Montana isn\u2019t experiencing an intense fire season, you can also expect smoke from California/the PNW to affect air quality as well as we saw from the Labor Day fires in Oregon, Washington and California this year. Many western states had terrible air quality and extreme limited visibility (in some areas, less than a quarter mile) and it wasn\u2019t even from local fires. \n\nIf you do buy or build a house, make sure you have defensible spacing and mitigate fire hazards around your home. I can enhance on this if need be, but don\u2019t want to get too long-winded here.\n\nTL;DR - wildfires happen every summer/fall to varying degrees and some areas will have more smoke than others. Do research on where you want to live and figure out how historically fire prone that area is.",
            "No don\u2019t move here. Smoke is terrible winters are cold as fuck I hear N Dakota\nIs nice.",
            "Western Montana can experience both the best and worst air quality in the country in the same year. It's all a crapshoot on how the fire season pans out.",
            "Those are great points to think about, thanks! Cincinnati is a fine city but we\u2019re looking for areas of the country with lower population density, and more access to outdoor activities. Other than the western states we\u2019re looking at Vermont and New Hampshire.",
            "I hope you get to move back!\n\nI totally understand the salty attitudes. Montana has had the problem for a while, but now anywhere with desirable qualities is seeing an influx. My city is one of the top locations for people leaving NYC and our housing prices are climbing accordingly. People are fanning out everywhere, as they have every right to do.",
            "Why is lower pop density such an issue? I see so many people go \"I hate people and wanna get away from it all\" and then turn around and surround themselves that think the same exact way, you think that's going to pan out well?  I don't see it anymore than a shallow and vindictive way of thinking.\n\n\nAlso  \n> still want decent amenities where we can easily drive to them.\n\nand\n\n> areas of the country with lower population density\n\nAre contradictory.  Montana suburbs are just as dense as any metropolitan area in the country, there's just no urban area to justify it. It's all suburbs. You are literally going to have to move 1+ hour from walmart to get out of the suburbs, and at that being surrounded by suburbs won't be too far off.\n\n\nAnd as far as outdoor activity goes, you have three months if that of decent weather.  It takes till June for mountains to be clear of snow and navigable, and fires season usually starts in mid August. Also completely ignoring the incoming administration's policy towards public access (Spoiler alert: Every attempt will be made to sell of state land and private land owners will be allowed to block off public land for themselves and profit heavily from it)"

Coming from SC you could pick any and it\u2019ll be more snow the first week of November (on a Tuesday )  than you may have seen so far in your life.

Consider the fact that most of Western Montana is in valleys and various other topography, trapping the smoke that blows in not only from our own fires, but also the fires in states west of us. *I* like a bit of the smell, personally, but it gets old quick when it sticks to your clothes and hair and so on. It can also be a health hazard if you're constantly exposed to it, especially if you're predisposed to respiratory problems. Summer is my least favourite season, especially in August.",
            "It depends on a lot of factors, but it's not unusual these days to have air quality alerts in some places on/off throughout the summer. If you have allergies or sensitivity to wood smoke, it can be pretty bad. Some summers have very little smoke -- it really depends on how much snow we got the previous winter and how much it rains in the early summer. When we have a hot and dry spring and summer, August is almost guaranteed to be bad.\n\n(Note that I'm talking about western MT here -- the smoke is generally not as bad in the eastern part of the state).",

            "I can't speak for other states, but up here in NW Montana, you should definitely expect Glacier to be closed.  The Sprague Fire (in Glacier itself) is spreading, and we're about to get two days of wind.  Evacuation Warnings are going out for everything west of Logan Pass on the Sun Road.  Seriously, expect it to be closed.  \n\nAs far as air quality goes, I live just outside kalispell near Lone Pine State Park.  Visibility is terrible.  It smells like smoke everywhere.  Spending an hour mowing the lawn will give you a cough and a sore throat for the rest of the day.  The whole valley is like that.  You can't see a thing and it hurts to breathe.  \n\nLibby and Eureka have fires nearby.  My coworker just got back from Billings and said it's pretty bad there.  Can't personally confirm that, though.  Missoula, Butte, and Bozeman aren't great, but they're supposedly better than here.  From what I hear West Yellowstone's air is mostly good right now, and I'm not aware of any major problems in Yellowstone itself.  \n\nBasically anything east of a fire and in a valley is going to be smokey.  Expect everywhere to look like Mars, in other words.  Fire danger is considered HIGH basically all over the northwest.  Storms tend to start fires, and wind spreads them.  So fires could break out and spread quickly.\n\nSorry for the bad news, but it is what it is.  The Sun Road will absolutely be closed, so if that's a must-see, you're going to have to wait.  ",

            "Thank you for this! I have been suffering and wondering about this information all morning. Unfortunately my job requires outdoor physical labor for 14 hours a day and there's nothing I can do about staying in doors. Are there any breathing techniques I can use to reduce the effects? Such as only breathing through the nose?",
            "How worried should we be here in Spokane about these fires?  I am new to the area.",

            "My wife got to leave early from work today due to the air being bad. She works in an office down town. Meanwhile I'm working outside like 30 miles from the fire fuckin dying and it's monitory overtime this week. That fire needs to burn my workplace down. Lol",
            "I'd say kind of refer to this guide.  Basically, take extra breaks indoors and try to keep your breathing rate down.  And if you can, get a breathing mask.\n\nhttps://www.spokanecleanair.org/documents/our_air/outdoor%20activity%20guidance%20with%20AQI_Spokane.pdf",
            "If you live downtown, not at all. Basically the biggest issue around Spokane right now is that we had a windstorm last year that knocked down a bunch of trees in the surrounding areas. Because of that, expect to see a good amount of fires in the coming years, but no danger to the city proper, except smoke.",
            "If you live near the area of the fires, then you should be pretty worried.  Otherwise, the smoke is your biggest concern.\n\nThis happens out here pretty much every summer to some extent.",
            "the saddest aspect is that they are becoming a yearly thing now. Hot summers, lack of rainfall and high winds mean trouble.",
            "Wait... does that mean... I had sex with Trump?",
            "Sounds like you need a new job.  What building does she work in?  Problem with a lot of the downtown buildings are that they are fairly old and thus have older ventilation systems so, like my building (Crescent Court), had the whole building smelling like it did outside.  I almost bailed this morning because it was so bad but ended up clearing up.",
            "Why do you think the windstorm from last year will make for more fires?",
            "At least it's nothing like last year.",
            "She works for WaMu. Its the same building as the knitting factory. ",
            "Because it knocked down a shit ton of trees, and with the dry weather we've been having, along with a lack of rain, the debris from the storm could ignite easier.",
            "It fell a ton of trees, and dead trees dry out and can contribute to large fires. ~~As an example, in 1990 Washington was [hit by a windstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_windstorm) in November, similar to last years. The following fall was [Firestorm](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2011/oct/16/91-firestorm-seared-into-areas-memory/), which devastated the region.~~\n\nMy bad, see below.",
            "According to your link, firestorm was not related in the slightest with any type of windstorm the year before. They sighted low humidity, 41 days without rain, and a windstorm that knocked over power lines and ignited the fires.  So many neighborhood trees toppled this last fall because they are 'top watered', meaning that humans are watering them with their sprinkler systems.  This makes for very shallow roots.  Trees in the forest have to look for water, and are much stronger because of this.  Out of 20 acres on the top of tower mtn, I didn't lose one tree.  The majority of all trees that fell were in neighborhoods and were promptly cleaned up.  I walked the tower property with the head of DNR last year and had a long talk on forest fires.  Dead, dry trees aren't their concern.  Forest fires move so fast that they don't have time to consume full logs.  Forest fires burn up brush and the bark on trees.  ",
            "The day of Firestorm was a very windy day. 60+ mph and constantly shifting directions. I was woken that day to a large pine tree snapping across the street from me. It luckily missed the houses, but blocked the street for a couple of hours. Then that afternoon I watched a tree in my backyard fall over on to a power pole. The bottom of the pole broke but it stayed standing. The tree arced and sparked for a half hour, and then was fine for days. We lost phone service, but the power stayed on. Deadfall from the previous year wasn't much of a factor but the heat of that Fall was.",
            "Sorry, that link was just the best summary I could find for Firestorm itself. I'll be honest, my assumption was based on what I heard from my cousins that were firefighters near Chewelah. They mentioned how many dead trees there were in the forest, and how difficult it made it to fight.\n\nHowever, after researching a bit more I think the dead trees may have been caused by the whole issue of letting wildfires burn vs. immediately putting them out.\n\nAlso, 20 acres on Tower Mountain sounds incredible.",
            "Smokey the Bear and his campaign on saving forests really hurt our forests.  Forests need to burn from time to time, and you're right; putting them out so quick is a real issue.  When Lewis and Clark walked our forests, the trees were big, resistant to fire, and there was little brush on the forest floor.  Preventing wildfires allowed our brush to really grow and become major fuel.  ",
            "The Smokey the Bear campaign was actually changed around 2000 to reflect that idea.\n\nWe also treated our forests like factories for the timber industry for decades, leading to unhealthy forests, and Smokey's message was reflective of those values at the time.\n\nNobody seems to remember  Woodsy the Owl though...give a hoot, don't pollute."

This should be common sense: denser tree canopy reduces sunlight heating the forest floor and it also inhibits water evaporation, making forests wetter. Thinner trees burn easier, and hotter. More air space between trees provides more oxygen, and allows more wind which can fan flames and increase movement of wildfires. I could link lots of evidence-based info about this but people don't usually read any of it. Here's [a documentary](https://vimeo.com/79239043) about efforts made by the timber industry to push anti-science views about logging and interfere with research about it.\n\nYour comments about \"old growth\" are confusing. Old growth results from leaving forests unmolested, not logging them. The \"growth\" part can and often does refer to more than trees: trees/shrubs/animals/etc. all work together to form an ecosystem. A functioning forest (distinguished from a stick farm that is common in areas managed by the timber industry) is a lot more resistant to fires, diseases, over-infestation of so-called pest organisms, and other issues.",

Every summer we choke on smoke and use oil to import wood products from other countries. We pretend to care about the environment, but it's all show for the NIMBYs.",
            "You are completely wrong on so many levels it's sad. This is why we are destined for more huge fires and more smoke. \n\nOur species are fire adapted, western larch only live in our region. They do not grow in the shade of other trees. They are adapted to stand replacing fires to survive. Lodgepole pine has a mix of serotinous cones to release seed when heated. Ponderosa pine forests were traditionally found as individuals or in clumps with large grass openings within a fire maintained ecosystem (we have historical photos and dendrochronological data). We're losing millions of acres of ponderosa pine habitat because we don't have fires thinning out and killing the Douglas and grand firs. \n\nWe pulled fire out of the equation 80 years ago and are now paying the price with dense forests full of fuel and disease. A 50% harvest by diameter class would promote multiple size classes which is the best way to leave it, if you want future old growth structure. You need horizontal and vertical diversity, you need multiple age classes. Then you need time. \n\nCommon sense is realizing all things suffer and die as density goes up. People, mice, trees. With trees you just get more dry fuel for huge, stand replacing fires and the cycle starts again. \n\nYou have misconstrued ideas about the fire triangle and how wild fires grow and spread.

            "I responded to your comments about thinning, then you Moved the Goalpost to fire suppression which I didn't realize was a topic we're discussing. Thinning and fire suppression are not dependent on one another. Thicker forests can burn for healthy cycles, without burning up completely as often happens with timber industry stick farms or clearcut areas.\n\n>We pulled fire out of the equation 80 years ago\n\nNot really. Fire suppression has become common, but prescribed burns have been happening in that time (although under-funded and not practiced enough).\n\n>dense forests full of fuel and disease.\n\nI've already explained that forests are wetter when not thinned, you've totally ignored all that. When I learn of disease outbreaks or over-proliferation of pests in forests, it seems these are nearly always in logged areas.\n\n>Common sense is realizing all things suffer and die as density goes up. People, mice, trees.\n\nPardon?? More animal density results in more manure on forest floors, which is excellent fertilizer. Animals when they die are decompose (if not eaten) also are good for fertilizing plants. You've not given any reason for believing that more density is bad in any way. You seem to be just repeating timber industry dogma, there's no proof anywhere. I linked a documentary that cites a lot of information about these topics and you're completely ignoring all that info.\n\n>With trees you just get more dry fuel for huge\n\nThere's your \"dry fuel\" again, after I explained that thicker forests are wetter and older trees don't burn as easily.\n\n[This study](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2696) analyzed wildfire characteristics in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion. It was found that old-growth forest protected for spotted owl did not burn as frequently or severely as timber-managed and salvage-logged areas. [This study](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.1492) compared forest protection status (according to Gap Analysis Program ranking) with wildfire characteristics for 1500 fires affecting 9.5 million hectares from 1984-2014. GAP1 and GAP2 areas that have higher protection burned less severely than GAP3 and GAP4 areas where more \"management\" is allowed. \"We note that we are not the first to determine that increased fire severity often occurs in forests with an active logging history (Countryman 1956, Odion et al. 2004).\" [This one](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6004/2/4/29) is again about fire severity vs. protected or logged areas. In most cases, fuel-reduction logging was associated with higher fire severity. Highest-severity fires were in logged areas.\n\nOK so none of that is about forest health such as disease rates or diversity of natural species. I have lots science-based info about that (mostly pertaining to Oregon where I've lived the most, but OR and WA forests are extremely similar and in some cases (border areas) they're the same forests). But before I do even more work here, let's see if you can confront the info I've mentioned already on a factual reasonable basis.\n\nBTW, the Bureau of Land Management [actively shuts out](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/blm-plans-to-shut-science-and-public-out-of-logging-and-vegetation-removal-projects-across-the-west) science and public commentary from their decisions about forestry.

So 10% contained means an estimated 10% of the perimeter of the fire is no longer active and able to spread. \n\nThis is different than \u201cLined\u201d. A fire can be lined (hand line dug, retardant drop, water, dozer line, roadway, etc) but is still actively burning and given weather conditions may still allow the fire to jump those lines. In this sense a fire could be (numbers for example) 50% lined but only 20% contained, meaning 30% of those lines put in around the fire may still be jumped. Until those lines hold and the fire is out cold against them will the containment number go up.",

And it\u2019s not even just that. Those same people are probably making bad decisions daily when it comes to their health and their offspring. Whether it\u2019s pumping them with junk food or smoking cigarettes near them, any bad example will do. Those types of people will be less likely to survive further on down the road because they refuse to educate and protect themselves. Even with simple matters. And in the process they are not only screwing their own kids up, but future generations. It\u2019s honestly a feat for a lot of humans to think.",
            "No. For her. Yeah, it sucks for the kid. But what are YOU going to do about it? Feel sorry or actually do something for the kid? No one will help this kid. Just like no one has helped the kids who have parents who refuse to wear masks for covid and put their kids at risk for getting it. Or what about the people who refuse to vaccinate their kids putting them at risk for serious illness? Nobody helps those kids either. You gotta stop worrying about every single person. Some people just won\u2019t listen no matter what you do. And ultimately their kids are their responsibilities. You can feel sorry all you want but unless you are actually helping the kid, what does it matter? Nobody really cares enough to do anything. They just make a post on Reddit or Facebook and they bitch about it. Like in this situation, the OP could of said something to the mother. But what would that have done? Caused a confrontation that resulted in nothing helpful coming from the situation? Calling the police who do nothing about it?The kid gets put in foster care which is terrible 9 out of 10 times (which is highly unlikely in this situation because people beat, neglect and drug their kids and still evade their kids getting taken away). So really, what do you propose should of happened? If this lady wants to be out in it with her kid, ultimately it\u2019s on her. Nobody can really stop her. Natural selection.",
            "I appreciate your argument, though to be clear I believe it can still be considered natural selection despite the child having no say. If a creature had a trait that gave them the ability to keep their offspring's vital respiratory organs from being harmed, that would be considered natural selection, and the reverse (not having that trait) is also true. Again not the most heartwarming comment in my opinion, but not technically incorrect.",

Some people will have better genetics and will be smarter with their decisions, ensuring their survival. They learn to adapt and succeed. The ones with less favorable genes and who are less intelligent of the species will eventually die out because they could not adapt accordingly. Or they refuse to adapt, like some people do. This all takes time but that\u2019s how it happens. Natural selection and evolution are slow processes but they stop for no one. We can just disagree because there\u2019s no point in arguing with someone who doesn\u2019t even understand the concept.",
            "I don't think it requires that. Over time creatures with better traits (for successful reproduction in particular) will have more success in reproduction. I would say putting the health of your offspring at risk, particularly before that offspring itself can reproduce, is mostly the same as putting your successful reproduction at risk.\n\nHappy to agree to disagree, though.",
            "You're incorrect.",

Air quality is now \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.\" If you live in a place with forced air, make sure the filters are clean, new and high quality.  Otherwise, consider getting an air filter machine.  Here's a good site to monitor [Air Quality.](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&cityid=260)\n\nHumidity was very high over the past few weeks outdoors but that recently changed this week.  However, indoors, humidity can be very dry due to artificial heaters.  If you have a humidifier on your hvac system make sure it's been adjusted for its winter setting.  If not, consider getting a standalone humidifier.  \n\nYour lungs are a bellwether. Ensure you're getting plenty of exercise, have a good diet, and that you're taking Vitamin D supplements.  There's all kinds of research into the lack of Vitamin D and how much that'll mess you up.  No sun=no D.   ",

            "I honestly can't tell what you're trying to communicate here. You're sick of all the negativity so thought you'd spew some more? Or did you start off intending to be sincere and just got carried away with being funny and sarcastic (I'm often guilty of this myself.)? I assume the latter because so much of what you wrote is complete bullshit or just the thinking of somebody who belongs in a major metro area.\n\nI ask because I really do love Spokane. I'm from the Boston area, lived in Asia for 4 years and have traveled the world and this country quite a bit. I was excited and proud to move back to Spokane. So I hope that you also love it here because here deserves people who love it.\n\nSorry if I've missed what you hoped was satire. If so, I honestly apologize for being critical and would happily play along with picking on ourselves. It's not perfect here by any means - I totally get that! ",
            "I'll bite. I love this place: \n\n1 - School. Such a variety of options for higher level education! From the two cheap, yet respected community colleges - to EWU to Gonzaga, Whitworth and the Riverpoint WSU campus, there\u2019s an option for everyone to get an education. Paired with low cost of living, your financial aid goes that much further than it would in say, Seattle or Portland. \n\n2 - Hospitals. They\u2019re plentiful and provide great care - not to mention the jobs they provide to our area. \n\n3 - Nature. I know, near nature, near perfect blah blah blah\u2026 but it\u2019s true. This place is beautiful. The neighborhood I live in is full of trees and wildlife, and the areas surrounding Spokane are full of great parks, camping areas, ski/snowboard resorts, lakes and rivers. \n\n4 - Smiles. People smile at you on the street, even if you don\u2019t know them. That\u2019s awesome. \n\n5 - Pride. Sure there\u2019s a ton of Spokane-hate around here. But have you ever tried to bash Spokane to someone who loves this area? The amount of pride that Spokanites - true, hometown proud Spokanites - have in their city is inspiring, and they will fight to tell you why it\u2019s great day after day. It outweighs the hate any day! The haters are louder, that\u2019s all.\n\n6 - The Inlander. It\u2019s awesome and I hope it never goes away - viva that awesome newspaper!\n\n7 - Bloomsday, Hoopfest, Zags Basketball, Shock Football, Iron Man, etc. Spokane is voraciously active, and it\u2019s citizens show enormous support for the things that make us special. \n\n8 - Pig Out in the Park. My favorite event of the whole year! Sure, it\u2019s crowded, and it\u2019s not as cheap as it should be. But being in that swell of people all with the same goal of eating a log of cheesy fries and a deep fried Pop Tart makes me brim with civic pride. And it\u2019s become quite the music festival in the last few years, which only makes it better. \n\n9 - World\u2019s Fair. I know, we\u2019re pretty hung up on that whole Expo 74 thing\u2026 but we have every right to be! 40 years ago, a plucky little city called Spokane became the smallest city to ever win a bid for the World\u2019s Fair - a record we still hold today. It put us on the map, revitalized Downtown, gave us Riverfront Park, and left a legacy that we should still be actively proud of today. \n\n10 - BEER. So. Many. Breweries. They\u2019re opening everywhere! One just opened walking distance from my house! The Spokane beer scene is just getting started, and it\u2019s already awesome. In just a few years we\u2019ll be giving Oregon a real run for their money. Beer beer beer!",
            "Okay here's another list, I couldn't stop at ten.\n\n1) fat people. If there ever was a town to make me feel skinny, this is it.\n\n2) tweakers. If there ever was a town to make me feel emotionally stable and socially well adapted this is it.\n\n3) bible beaters. If there ever was a town that made me feel like a fricking genius for having a small understanding of nuclear and atomic physics, this is it.\n\n4) refugees. If there ever was a town that made all of the above people seem not so bad after talking to refugees from places like somalia, yemen, and burma, this is it.\n\n5) rednecks. If there ever was a town that made me feel like damn, I am a bigot against rednecks and bigots I should learn to love all people despite their willful ignorance and being racist, violent, jingoistic, fucktards, this is it.\n\n6) time warp. I don't feel like time is passing by here in Spokane because this place is stuck in the last century.\n\n7) no fear of apocalypse, after living here, I feel like I might not even notice.\n\n8) no temptation, because the cocaine is garbage, the women are morons, the arts are non-existent, and all the people fucking ignorant wankers, I'm never tempted to leave the house in search of a good time.\n\n9) nature, in lots of places I might be tempted to spend ages wandering around lush hiking trails, and soaking in natural beauty, here there's nothing but dirt and pinecones and an occasional turkey, so fuck it. More time for reddit.\n\n10) twilight zone. This was my favorite tv show as a kid, now I'm living it!!!\n\n",
            "I'll play!\n\n1 - My taxes are lower here because the wages are lower than comparable counties.\n\n2 -  It's really easy to be the smartest person in the room.\n\n3 - I can get anywhere in the greater Spokane area in 15 minutes.\n\n4 - Rent is *really* cheap, and I don't have to worry about spending more to get a luxury apartment--there aren't any.\n\n5 - It's really easy to identify the meth dealers.\n\n6 - There are some really, really nice people here, and not all of them are bible-thumping right-wing whackos.\n\n7 - There is great fishing, and you never have to get icky cleaning a fish because who the fuck would eat a fish caught in a Superfund site?\n\n8 - Owning firearms is *de riguer*, not grounds for the inquisition.\n\n9 - Pulling your firearm in a road-rage incident gets you elected to the state legislature.\n\n10 - Bonus extra-wide margin of win if you do a creepy-stalky video in your opponent's driveway.

Also Mills are consolidating and shipping logs further due to corporate investment, automation and lack of workers in the remote areas the lumber is processed.\n\n\n\nThe idea that fires dont occur in logged areas is patently false and just shows you\u2019re not really informed about the state of idaho and its fires. Fires can be more extreme in protected but unmanaged timberlands due to fuel build up but fires do occur in cut land all the time\u2026 we\u2019re not clearcutting anymore cleared areas generally create large abundance of dense ground cover which can move the fires from managed land to unmanaged land very easily.\n\nThousands of acres of harvested timberland burns every year in idaho.",

These trees have no economic value as they are too small, diseased, in totally inaccessible areas, or dead, so this is where socialism comes in to hire private companies to do good for the population at large and subsidizes the work since it's not profitable.\u00a0\n\n\nIdaho, a moocher state, should have no issue taking money from successful states to make this happen. Also, Florida Goetz sucks and should be deported to Somalia. And fuck trump.",

The data is complete and replete that the weather is changing abruptly from historical \"normals\" of which there is always variation, but our industrial experiment is the beginning of \"Venus syndrome\". This has been known for years, it is just that our ignorant, manic, bought and paid for politicians will not admit it, reign in big corporations, or even talk honestly with people, all your gadgets and conveniences have a price.

Fun times in the future as the valley gets more dense and the fumes increase! Maybe.\n\nNWS has a great climate summary here:\n\n[https://www.weather.gov/boi/climatesummary](https://www.weather.gov/boi/climatesummary)\n\nFor the lazy:\n\n>**FOG\u2026LOW CLOUDS AND INVERSION IMPACTS:**  \nFog occurrence is primarily limited to the winter months at Boise and the Treasure Valley.\u00a0 This fog is mostly advection fog meaning it moves here from some other place.\u00a0 In Boise dense fog spreads over the city on light West to Northwest flow and usually occurs after a moist air mass has produced measurable rain or snow over the area.\u00a0 If this precipitation is followed closely by a ridge of high pressure with a weak surface gradient, fog forms quickly as moisture gets trapped below the subsidence inversion and is not able to scour away. This situation is most likely if it occurs during the period from Thanksgiving\u00a0 to Valentine\u2019s Day when stagnant high pressure systems usually move over the area and stall.\u00a0 It also coincides with the coldest temperatures of the year and shortest period of daylight.\u00a0 The fog can become locally dense reducing visibility to less than one-quarter mile at the Boise Airport and vicinity.\u00a0 This low condition hampers airport operations as well as traffic on the busy I-84 corridor from Boise to Meridian and west into Canyon County.\u00a0 Cloud seeding operations are common in winter at the airport and may commence when the temperature drops to a critical level.\u00a0 This seeding operation helps to lift and break up the low clouds and may allow early morning airport operations to remain on schedule. In addition, smoke and haze from the many fireplaces in the Treasure Valley along with automobile exhaust is frequently trapped under the inversion layer. These particulates act as excellent condensation nuclei and enhance the production of dense fog and lower air quality in Boise and the Treasure Valley.\n\n>The strong inversion events may last several days or even weeks if the weather pattern stagnates.\u00a0 The extensive low clouds and widespread fog when combined with the long hours of winter darkness and cold will enhance the overall gloominess to weather conditions at this time of year.\u00a0 It is during these foggy and low cloud events when valley temperatures may not deviate by more than a few degrees from high to low temperature. The breakup of low cloud and fog in Boise is highly dependent on wind direction and speed,\u00a0 strength of weather systems passing over the area , and time of year.\n\n>In contrast to the long periods of cloudy and foggy weather in December and January, Boise and the Treasure Valley experiences many weeks of fine weather from Spring through early Autumn, with abundant sunshine, light winds and temperatures pleasant enough for most everyone.\u00a0 \u00a0",

When you look through the \"I'm thinking about moving to Boise\" posts and skip past the trolls it's literally one of the most commonly mentioned thing. \n\n\"What's Boise like?\"\n\n\"Well, we have a lot of out doors stuff, a great park system, pretty nice people, lots of food options but we also get these inversions where the air gets really shitty. In the winter its dark and super cold, in the summer it's hot and really smoky. They last for weeks if not a month\" is a really really typical response.\n\n\n\nBut to answer your initial question, yes this is typical. They last anywhere from a few days to about 6 weeks. Sometimes longer. And they can get MUCH colder than this. In rare cases you can have a week or so with a high in the single digits and lows in the negative 10-20 range. Burn bans will go into effect so no fires unless they're a primary means of heating your home.\n\nThe upside is that if you go up to Bogus it'll be nice and sunny and fairly warm. Also, it's kind of weird driving through the clouds and then being above them with a bright blue sky above and a blanket of fluffy white clouds below you.",
            "Yes, inversions happen every winter, some much worse than others. FWIW, they used to be even worse before modern emission controls and wood stoves. If I'm not mistaken, in the late 80s there was some kind of law requiring catalytic wood stoves in Boise or Ada County or something. If someone could look it up and find the details that would be great. I'm not sure what percentage still heat with wood compared to say 40 years ago, but that would be an interesting stat. As much as people are coming down on natural gas nowadays, it's far cleaner than everyone burning nasty green wood.\n\n> Because reddit is a complete joke and everyone outside of reddit knows it.\n\nWell, here's a pro tip. Your headline was simply \"air quality.\" Which implied you were going to offer some content or details. Instead you just asked a question without, apparently, doing any research of your own. In other words, low effort. Redditors tend to dislike that. And you should have left out the part about just moving here, because, it's irrelevant. \n\nOne more thing, it's kind of weird how the msms overuse the word \"inversion\" which is technically true, but it ignores the air pollution. The word \"smog\" used to be more prevalent too, but you rarely hear that  anymore.",

Rosenthal Box? If you have free time and can get your hands on four low to mid quality furnace filters and a box fan you basically tape them all together with the box fan on top like a cube, with the fan pulling air upwards."

            "Funny thing is, the air quality lately has been fairly good. But mid to late summer is when the fire season was in full swing channeling smoke through the valley this year. Compared to years past the smoke and bad air quality has been steadily increasing. Then with the effects of climate change as fires become increasingly more common along the west coast I think we will continue to see it get worse.\n\nI think good places to retreat to would require a little research. Since wind directions change, and where the smoke is coming from changes, there is no perfect answer. But generally, north Into the saw tooth mountains would be a good place to start looking.",
            "Our air quality has been really good this late week minus yesterday (I think it was). It\u2019s possible you are allergic to whatever is out here. But we do have fire season and this year was bad. Smoke from June through September (and bad smoke too). We also just had a fire kicking off smoke last night in eagle, so that didn\u2019t help.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",
            "Feel like it\u2019s been very fine over the last week",
            "Boise basically has a \u201csmoke season\u201d. End of summer. I\u2019ve been here 6 years, and you could realistically expect 2wks to a month of smoke every year. Always to varying degrees and lengths of course. This year has been very mild compared to the ones before. I would however expect smoke/fire to increase in frequency, length and severity with global warming and decline in snow pack and rain.",
            "I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s \u201cpollution\u201d but it is certainly smoke from wildfires and it lasts most of the summer.",
            "I think we should separate two things, air quality (pollution/smog) vs air quality (wildfire smoke). Boise has actually had relatively good air quality relative to wildfire smoke since mid Septemberish. I run quite regularly and felt like I had to take off the second half of the summer due to wildfire smoke. At the very least, I was checking my weather quality app every morning and whether I could run any given day was a gamble. It felt like the air quality due to wildfire smoke was terrible for multiple, weeklong periods of time this year. I don't think you can escape wild fire smoke, like you can \"get above\" smog. I've experienced wildfire smoke just as bad up at Bogus or a mountain peak as I have downtown, even on the same day. When it comes to air quality (pollution/smog) that doesn't become as noticeable till winter when it all sits in the valley. You CAN get above that, unlike wildfire smoke. If you do get out, the air quality always seems to be best during the early, early morning/daybreak. Overall, I only see both pollution/smog getting worse as more cars/people come to Boise. Same with the fire smoke season getting longer as the West is burning more and more frequently.",
            "We would usually go up to bogus basin or Idaho city for the day. Same applies to inversions to escape the heat/cold for a few hours. Smoke is hard to escape these last few years, it\u2019s definitely getting worse every year now",
            "You clearly moved here from outside the western US. Fire season is part of life in the West",
            "Part of it is our geography.",
            "I have asthma and it can get really bad sometimes. The fire season came early this year with that really bad heatwave we had in early June. This year and last year we had a couple of months of visibility smokey skies and we get the occasional dust storm on top of it. I have to run an air cleaner and humidifier to be able to breathe sometimes, I also buy expensive air filters for my hvac system. It hasn't been too bad the last few weeks though.",
            "Yeah, it has been fantastic for me with my asthma and allergies living here about 5 years. Get ready for about 4-6 months a year of bad air quality.",
            "Honestly this summer was pretty middle of the road for smoke. Over the past twenty years it has absolutely became worse and I don\u2019t see it getting any better. When winter comes we might also get quite a bit of inversion. You can try to get above the smoke but only sometimes can you get above it at bogus. If the smoke is bad you seriously cannot escape it and exercising during smoke season is very difficult. The allergies and crazy dry air are just the cherries on top.",
            "It seems like the air quality here, with the exception of wildfire smoke, goes up and down a lot so you can have patches of bad air for a week then good air and so on. The inversion layer that usually comes in winter isn\u2019t fun but typically doesn\u2019t last too long. Activities like agriculture and ag related burning can also cause air quality to stuffer. I compare this to places like Central Valley of California which is often in top 10 worst places and they just have bad air routinely. This area doesn\u2019t have the greatest air, but I\u2019d give it a B- (not counting wildfire). There are better places in Idaho, particularly up north, that have better air. When I travel up north then come back here I can tell the difference.",
            "There's something to be said about vehicle emissions. I don't know what that something is. One would need to look at the kinds of particulate matter affecting the air quality. I haven't bothered because there's not anything I can do about it. But I've biked a lot and in a lot of cities and I've found the valley to be one of the worst. I am defining this by the amount of times I am near vehicles and get caught in nasty exhaust that takes my breath from me and makes it very difficult to keep pedaling. I don't know anything about cars other than there are too many old nasty ones driving on local roads when I'm on them. I have been here a few years and definitely feel a difference in my general lung health and on top of that always battling congestion and dehydration.",

            "What about just going up the nearby hills and mountains? The valley is a reason why the air quality is so bad because the smoke gets trapped. So doesn\u2019t it follow that taking a drive to the top of the hills would allow one to rise above the smoke?\n\n\nEdit:  when you say fairly good, are you just speaking relatively? My understanding is that Boise is one of the worst 15 cities for air quality in general with or without firesmoke",

But my concern is for my mom who is in her 60s and enjoys 5 mile walks. She wants to get a German Shepherd or two for her retirement so she would need to wear them out.  I just don\u2019t see it working out for her in Boise without compromising her health, but I wish I was wrong",

            "Right.  I could tell the difference immediately coming into a treasure valley. Could see the layer of smog in the air",
            "We do have a nighttime inversion in the summer in the morning, but usually the smoke is still mixed to all layers of the lower atmosphere. Going higher will not allow you to escape in the summer. In the winter, persistent inversions trap pollution even during the day so the lowest levels of the atmosphere don't mix out when there is high pressure dominating the weather. In those cases you can go to the higher mountains to escape, but they'll be buried in snow.",
            "Yes relatively. Going higher will increase your chances of getting above the smog. I don't know how high you will need to go to get above it. But there is a layer where it gets worse going up before it gets better so keep that in mind. The altitude of that smog layer changes depending on the wind, density of air, and temperature in the valley. So just going to the top of the surrounding hills may work some days, and some days it won't.",
            "Where did you see that Boise is one of the worst 15 cities for air quality? Looking at this research, Boise isn't in the top 25 for pollution by any of their criteria: [https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities](https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities)\n\nHow many days a year is there fire smoke? It varies wildly by year from hardly any to majority of the summer, but overall as there have been more fires out west that are bigger and burn longer, it's gotten worse. When there's smoke, it can be smoky everywhere, so there isn't always somewhere close by to \"escape\"...really depends on where the fires are and what the weather pattern is doing. For example, here's a picture from the top of Bogus Basin this summer when the smoke was particularly bad: https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/wuvx75/picture253550604/alternates/FREE\\_768/PineCreekCam\\_2021-08-17\\_12-22am.jpg\n\nBoise, as you may have heard, is growing incredibly fast right now, so anything happening to mitigate existing pollution will probably be negated by the number of people moving here.",

            "You are not alone. I also thought it was the worst year for fire smoke.",
            "It wasn\u2019t an inversion you witnessed was it? Re: your layer of smog",
            "Probably, but anywhere you go west of Colorado is going to deal with wildfire smoke at some point. In the past two years I've experienced seen bad wildfire smoke in Boise, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Reno, Spokane, all of California, Jackson Hole, and Denver. Boise is probably the one of the worst because the smoke funnels here from CA/OR/WA/Canada. I'm not as knowledgable about smog in those places though, except I know Salt Lake gets a bad inversion during the winter.",
            "It\u2019s not far, summer is quicker than winter but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do it daily.",
            "I should have said topography.",
            "That would be cool.\n\nI would also add, it isn't just the design of the valley and fires, pollution from everyone. It is that you only get like 6-10 inches of rainfall a year and half of that is snow. A year or two ago we went like 4-5 months without a drop of rain.\n\nYou will also want to invest in some good hand creams, you need it in summer, winter, and about half the rest of the time. My wife's and my hand all just crack like eggs.",
            "Mornings when the air is dense and cold the smog layer should follow that and also be hanging at a lower altitude. So chances of getting above it in those surrounding hills should be much greater at that time.",

My mom wants to get a German Shepherd when she moves and if it can\u2019t go on a good walk with her in the Smokey areas she would need to find a way of wearing it out somewhere nearby with clean air. Maybe Boise is just too difficult to accomplish that right now",

            "Yep. I just spent a year in Texas and my dandruff problems almost went away.  From having to use head and shoulders twice a week to literally using it 2 or 3 times on the whole year.\n\nEdit: in the humid part of Texas. Humidity solves a lot of problems lol",

They'll put him on what I can only assume is a very costly, but not debilitating, payment plan and require him to meet certain requirements for X amount of years (probably like 8-10). After that so long as he's remained out of jail and kept the requirements they'll let him off for the rest. \n\nIt'll still suck for him (that's what it's for), but it's not like a life sentence of never-ending debt."

            "I love me a good landfill post. My general awareness of the Dynamis project was from the headlines. I'd guess that even \"Successful\" W.T.E. programs operate under a code of rather lax environmental standards. W.T.E. is just a more erudite way of saying, burning trash.\n\n\nAnyways, thank you for taking the time to articulate your position and experience with this issue. \n\n\n      ",
            "There is a reason that getting rid of tires (the main source of fuel for the proposed Dynamis project) is so problematic. Sure, you can burn, polymerize, oxidize, or otherwise convert them to something that isn't a tire, but that process will produce some emission byproducts. \n\nNow, you can make a \"zero emission\" plant, but  you'll have to capture the byproducts, and that is expensive. Importantly, too expensive to be profitable or more cost effective than existing landfill management and expansion. \n\nThe whole thing really was a boondoggle. Saying that it would help preserve space in the landfill, but then relying on bringing in extra waste tires to keep it going. \n\nMost waste management folks I've spoken with are of the Mind that the future is in cold mining. Compost and recycling will cover the bulk of waste, and the landfill will be used for the nasty stuff, the food contaminated plastics and dirty diapers that only make up a small portion of the waste stream.",
            "> Odors mostly have disappeared \n\nYou mean since 2012? I'm pretty sure they've opened new cells which may or may not be a factor. And what is most of the stench from, has there ever been a study? I always thought it was from thousands of disposable diapers which is one environmental concern which seems to have fallen through the cracks. If only there was some way to reuse diapers. \n\nAlso, someone's gonna say it, the dump was there before Hidden Springs. ",
            "\n\nThanks.  Yes, not an issue you'll hear much of, though more now that recycling is falling flat on its face.  In Idaho, yes, lax standards and lax enforcement for all air quality permits.  No existing WTE in Idaho though.  That was part of the issue -- Idaho DEQ themselves told us that they were not aware of any industrial plant that had ever been permanently shuttered in Idaho due to failure to meet air standards.  Rather, the permits were changed so they could emit more.",
            "The tires!  They definitely have a lot of stored energy, but agree completely that to bring them in to burn in our TV from all over the west in an experimental plant just wasn't a great idea.  Especially since Dynamis stated they would not stop burning during Orange or Red air quality days.\n\nIt looks like Boise's partnership with the plastic => diesel is a fairly good idea, except that the plant is in Salt Lake (though plastic is quite light and largely compressible).  The key here is i) a plant exists that is being monitored now, so we aren't guinea pigs; ii) most critically, though a heated process ('pyrolysis'), the plastic isn't being burned but broken down to precursor polymers -- burning (oxidation) of course takes out the energy so there wouldn't be any diesel potential.  I haven't looked into what happens to the chlorine.\n\nI mostly agree that you could get acceptable emissions if 1) you spend far more than our current landfill costs for state of the art controls and 2) if you know how to operate them.  Looks like nitric oxides, which you simply get from burning air, are the hardest to control, though also not directly as toxic.\n",
            "Yes but Hidden Springs wasn't the issue -- we are talking stinking up Boise and Hill Rd, which has residences long before the landfill opened in 1972.  As far as that goes, there were also people living in Dry Creek before then.  Riverglen students on Gary Lane called the 'Landover Estates' the 'Landfill Estates' due to the stink [though yes, Riverglen and Landover were built long after the landfill opened, but not after it became a regional landfill].  As to opening new cells, in part, but the existing 'Hidden Hollow' cell will continue to generate gases for at least a quarter century.  Some of the stink was surface odor from not covering it properly, and because it now forms the highest ridge in the local foothills.  But the super stink is from generated H2S internally, which can be vacuumed and burned to a much less obnoxious SO2.  As to diapers, perhaps (and surely you jest as to reuse), but the operators suspected gypsum from drywall with its high sulfur content that was being landfilled during that tear down and build cycle. ",
            "More directly, the landfill spent some of your trash dollars to install far more wells and pipes to collect the gases at the Hidden Hollow cell.  That is what decreased the odors, as well as the political pressure to pull a strong enough vacuum to capture the H2S despite the collateral to the engines.  When Fortistar is out and if the County wants to proceed, we should use more expensive turbines instead of internal combustion engines to avoid the issue with too much O2. ",
            ">Rather, the permits were changed so they could emit more.\n\nCan you elaborate on that?",
            "> more \n\nBTW, the new cell is close to Eagle and the proposed 'Dry Creek Ranch', so if that goes off in 25 years or so it will be interesting political fireworks indeed.",
            "Permits are written for a certain amount of pollution.  If that amount is exceeded by a certain threshold over a certain time(which requires sampling), one might think that would means turning it off.  Instead, the polluter can go to DEQ and say please can I pollute more, and the answer is usually yes.  Exactly this happened with the landfill flares that were emitting far in excess of the permitted SO2.  They simply went and got a permit to cover the, if I remember right, greater than 10-fold increase.",
            "Forgot all about the flaring. So it's the flaring that's adding more SO2?\n",
            "It was and is.  But, in this case, I would agree that the DEQ had little choice but to increase the permitted level, as what else to do?  SO2 does have an odor, rather industrial like a burnt match, but it is far less nasty and bad for you than H2S.  There was an issue with how they wrote the permit -- didn't take into account the background levels from the dump itself.\n\nThere are some (from my perspective) great people in DEQ that thanked us for our participation.  They, like most agencies, have a leader appointed by the governor, so who knows what direction they get from the top.  The main permit writer on Dynamis publicly stated that he had no idea if it would work, but in his opinion, it should be built and then monitored.  That's where the rub was, in my mind.   Even if it performed very poorly, it almost certainly would not have been shuttered (too much invested!), and in the end may well have been a very expensive trash burner and natural gas electric generator that would have increased our landfill costs tremendously via several mechanisms."
