In the case of the [Malibu fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/california-wildfire-malibu-pepperdine-university) that broke out last night, our reporter looked at why Pepperdine University students were told to stay put despite residents being told to evacuate. \n",

Versus a lot of these working class families - those houses had been passed down through generations.

      ">I recall James Taylor singing over and over on the news radio station between updates on the 1978 Mandeville and Kanan fires, both of which started on October 23rd of that year, and which could be seen burning toward each other—systematically wiping out large parts of Malibu and Pacific Palisades—from an upstairs window of my house in Brentwood. It was said then that the Kanan fire was burning on a twenty-mile front and had already jumped the Pacific Coast Highway at Trancas Canyon. The stand in the Mandeville fire, it was said, would be made at Sunset Boulevard. I stood at the window and watched a house on a hill above Sunset implode, its oxygen sucked out by the force of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Some thirty-four thousand acres of Los Angeles County burned that week in 1978. More than eighty thousand acres had burned in 1968. Close to a hundred and thirty thousand acres had burned in 1970. Seventy-four thousand and some had burned in 1975, sixty-some thousand would burn in 1979. Forty-six thousand would burn in 1980, forty-five thousand in 1982. In the hills behind Malibu, where the moist air off the Pacific makes the brush grow fast, it takes about twelve years before a burn is ready to burn again. Inland, where the manzanita and sumac and chamise that make up the native brush in Southern California grow more slowly (the wild mustard that turns the hills a translucent yellow after rain is not native but exotic, introduced in the nineteen-twenties in an effort to reseed burns), regrowth takes from fifteen to twenty years. Since 1919, when the county began keeping records of its fires, some areas have burned eight times.\n",
      "\n",
      ">In other words, there is nothing unusual about fires in Los Angeles, which is, after all, a desert city with only two distinct seasons: one beginning in January and lasting three or four months, during which storms come in from the northern Pacific and it rains—often an inch every two or three hours, and sometimes, in some places, an inch a minute—and one lasting eight or nine months, during which it burns, or gets ready to burn. What was unusual this year, after two years of drought and a third year of less than average rainfall, was that it was ready to burn while the June fogs still lay on the coastline. On the first of May, months earlier than ever before, the California Department of Forestry declared the start of the fire season and began hiring extra crews. By the last week in June, there had been more than two thousand brush and forest fires in California. Three hundred and twenty of them were burning that week alone.\n",

If you look at the pictures closely, you'll see even in the totally destroyed neighborhoods, a lot of the trees survived.  Insulating concrete form sounds interesting.  I hope it's as good as it sounds and I also hope there are regulations in place to require new builds to use it if it works.  From my perspective (I was actively fighting fires near Lincoln and Woodbury) the buildings themselves were the worst problem of all, far worse than trees and debris.  The thing is, I also know of houses that had metal roofing and concrete walls that burned down.  Maybe if they were all built like that it would have mitigated the problem, but the interiors of houses are always somewhat flammable no matter what you do, and even those robust houses couldn't survive being completely surrounded.  It's kind of weird though typing it out because in the same paragraph I said pine trees can survive but metal and concrete houses can't.  But... that's what I saw.  Actually the very house I am describing with a metal roof and concrete walls that was in my parents neighborhood had a partially built back house they were working on that was literally just two by four wood framing, and it survived while their house did not.  I guess all I can really say with certainty is there is an element of randomness to what burns and what doesn't that seems to not care too much about what building materials are used.  Enough heat and wind concentrated on a spot seems like it can take almost anything out.  I definitely want to see better materials used in the rebuild though.  That seems essential to me.\n",
