The themes and tropes covered in this book paint a picture of what to expect from them in regards to water and land policy.

       "  'I have some training with the UC Agriculture and Natural Resources department, and while I’m not an expert, I wanted to clarify what Trump mentioned at this meeting. Opening \"pumps and valves\" isn’t really accurate, but there is a real plan to build an underground water tunnel from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California, called the **Delta Conveyance Project**: [https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance](https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance)\\n\\nA TL;DR of the project:\\n\\n\\\\- The plan was proposed the 1960s, but the project has been delayed for decades due to debates over costs, logistics, and environmental impacts.\\n\\n\\\\- It gained traction again in 2016 and was approved by Gavin Newsom in 2019.\\n\\nTo expand on the main challenges: Firstly, the actual cost to build it goes up the longer it\\'s delayed (inflation). Secondly, there are logistical difficulties, as it\\'s a very deep and very long tunnel.  Thirdly, is the environmental impact. This has caused the most contentious debates, as the water tunnel could potentially impact the health of the delta ecosystem.\\n\\nOne example that keeps cropping up is around a species of fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta called the **delta smelt**, which are considered an \"indicator species\". If the smelt have a stable population, the water quality is good. If the smelt population declines, the water quality is bad. Protections for the delta smelt are about the Delta\\'s ecosystem and water quality, rather than the fish specifically. There is more about the environmental impact report for the San Juaquin delta released by the CA Department of Water Resources here: [https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project)',\n",

Rump is correct that theoretically we could divert more water from the San Joaquin Delta into the Aqueduct but that would mean less water available for farms and orchards, and riparian ecosystems, in the northern Central Valley which is why local farmers (and their environmentalist “enemies”) staunchly oppose doing so.\\n\\nUp here in the northern CV we are already pumping our aquifers dry, to the point where the ground is subsiding and residential wells are failing, in spite of the annual snowmelt retained in reservoirs that flows through the canal system to irrigate crops. There already isn’t enough water to meet demand, especially in drought years when farmers are often forced to let their crops and orchards die for lack of water.\\n\\nThe huge farms in Imperial County get their water from the Colorado River via a separate canal system. The water sent down the Aqueduct largely goes to supply homes and businesses in southern CA, or in the words of northern CV farmers “nothing but pools and golf courses”. They despise the LA region for always demanding more water almost as much as they despise the Delta smelt, an endangered fish species that has become a target because of the small percentage of water allowed to flow out of reservoirs and down the rivers to barely sustain the riparian and Delta ecosystems and prevent salt water intrusion, something local farmers consider “a waste of precious water”. \\n\\nI guarantee that neither northern CV farmers nor the environmental community want to send more water down south. It’ll be interesting to see whether the local farmers’ love for Rump overrides their own economic self-interest. If they finally cave in to his demands to “open the spigot” into the Aqueduct, after decades of ferociously opposing doing so, it will be yet another sign that Rump worship has become the overriding factor that controls their lives.',\n",

       "  \"Before the aqueduct system, snow melt from the Sierras flowed into the deltas.  California now captures a good portion of that water, and shunts it into the aqueduct system, where it's sent on a long journey south to irrigate fields in the central valley and provide water for millions of people in parts of central and southern California. Enough of the snow melt, however, is still allowed to flow into the deltas to maintain fragile delta ecosystems.\\n\\nTrump has been wanting the state to shunt more of that water away from the deltas and into the aqueduct system, to make more available for agricultural use and urban populations (powerful California farmers, and developers).\\n\\nHe's now using the devastating fires in the Palisades and Altadena as a pretense for his executive order to take control of California water resources and direct them how he wishes.\\n\\nBased on his justification, it's a dumb idea because the Santa Ynez reservoir being empty, and the hydrants running dry, are not due to lack of water from the north. The Santa Ynez reservoir had been emptied last February in anticipation of repairs for a tear in its cover. The hydrants ran dry because the demand during the unprecedented fires (estimated to be 25,000 gallons per minute) caused three 1 million gallon water tanks up in the hills to run dry, and the pumping stations could not pump fast enough to meet the demand. However it may not have made a significant difference because the primary issue was that firefighters were facing  firestorm with hurricane force winds that grounded air support, the primary instrument in fighting wildfires.\\n\\nThe claim that shunting more water south to fight fires also ignores the fact that there's no place to hold additional water when existing reservoirs are full, and we have ocean water we can use to fight fires if necessary when the fire is close enough to the coast.\",\n",

       "  '\\nArticle: In October, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed\\xa0Executive Directive No. 9, which established a citywide capital infrastructure plan.\\n\\nThe directive was a breakthrough for Los Angeles and a demonstration of poor governance: Such capital plans — which outline priorities and strategies for building infrastructure — are commonplace in local governments. But Los Angeles, a peculiar island in the world of governance,\\xa0did not have one.\\n\\nI mention Bass’ directive not to exonerate from her current political crisis nor to take a side in the bitter battle over responsibility for this month’s fires.\\n\\nInstead, I wish to emphasize that the big controversy over the fires’ causes — faulty hydrants, dry reservoirs, prepositioning of fire engines or lack of personnel — is way too small. \\xa0\\nLos Angeles, buffeted by disaster, needs to argue about a bigger challenge: How and whether the city government, after a half-century of shirking basic responsibilities, might start governing itself again.\\xa0\\nIf L.A. decides to get serious, it will be starting near the bottom. The city, which includes Pacific Palisades, doesn’t have a comprehensive catalog of its infrastructure or a plan for maintaining it. It’s a city that tolerates three water main breaks a day and disintegrating streets. It’s a city with a backlog of sidewalk repairs that would take years to process.\\n\\nEven worse, it’s a city that has all but given up on planning. In California, cities are required by law to make and update general plans, covering elements from conservation to public safety. But L.A.’s official planning documents are mostly out of date. Despite some recent updating work, the community plans — which are part of the city’s land use plan — date to the 1990s. A few city plans — for facilities and infrastructure — are more than 50 years old.\\n\\nPlanning is about imagining a future. A city that doesn’t plan is a city that doesn’t tap its collective imagination. And that’s the bitter irony behind these tragic fires. Los Angeles, a city world-famous for imagination, experienced a monumental failure of imagination.\\n\\nI mean, how could a city that produced films of itself destroyed by so many unusual disasters — tidal waves, ice storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, zombies, infections, sharknados and a 50-foot-tall woman — not have been ready for an epic fire?\\n\\nThe lame excuses by Mayor Bass and Los Angeles fire officials — that the fire that destroyed Pacific Palisades was faster and stronger than any they could fight — are confessions of this failure. \\xa0And they should have imagined this blaze — more powerful fires had recently destroyed other parts of California. City fire Chief Kristin Cowley admitted on TV that larger fire emergencies “demand an expansion of our life-safety service capabilities.”\\n\\nWhy didn’t L.A. make plans equal to its challenges?\\n\\nOne answer is corruption. The real estate developers and public employee unions that dominate city governments don’t want to be constrained by plans; they prefer to use their power to negotiate special deals with elected officials. And elected officials like the freedom to make ad hoc decisions about developments in their own districts. This sort of decision-making often runs on a pay-to-play system. Those who have power or money get what they want. And the City Council members get donations or, worse, illegal favors. This is why federal prosecutors have spent recent years bringing charges against so many city officials.\\n\\nMayor Bass could have changed this system after she took office in 2022. She could have revamped the City Council, cleaned out the 1980s-style city bureaucracy or asked voters to rewrite the city charter, L.A.’s constitution. Instead, she offered up only minor changes to the charter in last year’s elections and emphasized collaboration within the existing system.',\n",

There was zero thought here,” said Michael Gonzales, 47, whose home burned down in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy neighborhood that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. His family of five was camped out in a hotel in Santa Monica on Wednesday as they began figuring out where they will live. \"\\n\\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-mayor-fire-response.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-mayor-fire-response.html)\\n\\nWas she in vacation in Ghana or was this official LA mayor business trip does anyone know?',\n",

An insider of the current system — developer Steve Soboroff — is in charge of the fire recovery. Perhaps Bass, once the smoke has cleared, will build on October’s announcement of a capital investment plan and do something bolder. But she hasn’t demonstrated that sort of vision yet.\\n\\nL.A. is a world-class place but without a world-class city government. And it has no plan to create one.\\n\\nIf the city won’t fix itself, state agencies might intervene — by assuming some emergency responsibilities as the state government has done with law enforcement in\\xa0Oakland and Bakersfield. The state could also convene L.A. residents — I’d suggest using citizens assemblies — to create new plans for the city.\\n\\nThe state would be fully justified in such a takeover. Los Angeles — unable to match state gains in employment and education — has been a drag on California since the early 1990s recession. Poverty rates have soared in Los Angeles as they’ve flattened or declined elsewhere.\\n\\nCalifornia will never turn itself around until it puts out the fire that is Los Angeles.',\n",

The city’s firefighting network, the Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) maintains a network of 177 independent underground water cisterns, with sizes varying from 75,000 US gallons (280,000 L) to over 200,000 US gallons (760,000 L) depending on location with a total storage capacity of over 11 million U.S. gallons (42 million liters) of water. These cisterns are easily spotted at street level with manholes labeled CISTERN S.F.F.D surrounded by red brick circles or rectangles.

The water pressure does not hold. \\n\\nThere’s a lot to be said about the failing infrastructure in the US and the lack of updates (a 40 year old issue), but I’m not sure why people are pretending that updating an entire municipal water system to accommodate running hundreds or thousands of fire hydrants simultaneously is a fix that can come in 2, 4 or even 8 years.

An alternate route — running largely through uninhabited parkland along the eastern edge of the Arroyo Seco valley by the Rose Bowl stadium parking lot — was rejected.\\n\\n>But as covenants and other blunt tools of racial oppression were ruled illegal, local officials turned to less overt but no less effective methods of displacement: neighborhood demolition and rebuilding projects best known as “urban renewal.” These neighborhoods, fondly remembered by their residents, were labeled as blighted by the city in its 1962 General Plan. It was no coincidence that northwest Pasadena and other neighborhoods around it were the same that were “redlined” by the federal mortgage evaluators HOLC in the 1930s. They were the neighborhoods where Black Pasadenans lived. \\n\\n>The city followed this same circular logic to determine the siting of the Foothill Freeway. After the planners and the local officials debated between a handful of alternatives, the “Green route” — which drove right through the neighborhoods with majority residents of color — was ultimately selected because it fit best with the City’s General Plan. The General Plan, of course, was informed by the HOLC maps, which were themselves largely products of the racial make-up of the city at the time.

It was said then that the Kanan fire was burning on a twenty-mile front and had already jumped the Pacific Coast Highway at Trancas Canyon. The stand in the Mandeville fire, it was said, would be made at Sunset Boulevard. I stood at the window and watched a house on a hill above Sunset implode, its oxygen sucked out by the force of the fire.\\n\\n>Some thirty-four thousand acres of Los Angeles County burned that week in 1978. More than eighty thousand acres had burned in 1968. Close to a hundred and thirty thousand acres had burned in 1970. Seventy-four thousand and some had burned in 1975, sixty-some thousand would burn in 1979. Forty-six thousand would burn in 1980, forty-five thousand in 1982. In the hills behind Malibu, where the moist air off the Pacific makes the brush grow fast, it takes about twelve years before a burn is ready to burn again. Inland, where the manzanita and sumac and chamise that make up the native brush in Southern California grow more slowly (the wild mustard that turns the hills a translucent yellow after rain is not native but exotic, introduced in the nineteen-twenties in an effort to reseed burns), regrowth takes from fifteen to twenty years. Since 1919, when the county began keeping records of its fires, some areas have burned eight times.\\n\\n>In other words, there is nothing unusual about fires in Los Angeles, which is, after all, a desert city with only two distinct seasons: one beginning in January and lasting three or four months, during which storms come in from the northern Pacific and it rains—often an inch every two or three hours, and sometimes, in some places, an inch a minute—and one lasting eight or nine months, during which it burns, or gets ready to burn. What was unusual this year, after two years of drought and a third year of less than average rainfall, was that it was ready to burn while the June fogs still lay on the coastline. On the first of May, months earlier than ever before, the California Department of Forestry declared the start of the fire season and began hiring extra crews.

LA *County* Fire has a whole slew of hand crews. As, obviously, does CalFire, which has jurisdiction over the whole state. Several times it references \"LA\" without specifying whether referencing LA City Fire or LA County Fire or colloqually just the general metropolitan area (usually LA City Fire, but still, sloppy writing).\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s unusual for a city FD to rely on larger fire jurisdictions (e.g. county, CalFire, or USFS) for hand crews, since most wildland tends to be in unincorporated areas. That said, given the large wildlands even within LA city administrative boundaries, particularly the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains, I generally do agree LA City should have at least a few permanent units. \\n\\nThis weakness would\\'ve made no difference with the Palisades Fire. Everyone was on alert due to the extreme red flag warnings. LA County Fire had hand crews ready in Malibu, and CalFire was mobilized in preparation as well. Once the fire started, hand crews from LA County were on the scene, and within the day, tons of hand crews from various different fire agencies. (And just to be clear, this would have zero to do with the Eaton Fire, since that\\'s out of LA city admin boundaries.)\\n\\n(And calling the section detailing Palisades Fire \"Shorthanded\" seems entirely misleading considering they even detail how many hand crews were on the scene that day. Ultimately they had to pull back because of extreme winds making things dangerous, not lack of manpower.)\\n\\nIn general, its good that these recent fires are putting eyes on whether our fire fighting units are properly resourced. But what LA City needs hand crews for are going to be for days without major red flag warnings, where CalFire isn\\'t necessarily pre-positioned in the area, and so they don\\'t always have to rely on LA County Fire to help out on more \"minor\" brush fires within their jurisdiction. (Heavy caveat on minor not necessarily meaning any less dangerous.

That\\'s how they generate super granular maps like [this](https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/fhsz-files/los_angeles.pdf?rev=83991815204b4e87b551a1b8d4ac52a3&hash=4C2E1A24FABA45235A68A423F15A28A6).  I work in disease risk prediction, so I\\'ll use that as an example.  Telling someone that they are at \"high risk\" of developing breast cancer is somewhat meaningless in a vacuum and certainly doesn\\'t give enough detailed information to be a helpful basis to make difficult decisions like whether they should get preventative surgery (which itself carries risk and downsides).  Instead you might communicate their lifetime probability of developing the disease, or at early stages of the disease, their expected 5-year survival probability before and after different interventions.  This isn\\'t to say that disease progression isn\\'t highly heterogeneous and difficult to predict at an individual level, similar you point out with wildfire hazard to specific properties.  But we can still communicate our best probabilistic estimates based on what we know, particularly when those estimates are already the sole basis of the categorical hazard labels we\\'re assigning anyway.\\n\\nRemember, in a sense every probabilistic statement is wrong.  The truth is 0 or 1; your property either will or won\\'t burn in the next decade.  But the probability characterizes our uncertainty in order to help make decisions.  Whether or not to move is a huge decision for families.  Giving something like an estimated 10-year fire probability would be way more helpful for this decision than just saying \"high risk\".',\n",

The difficulty is that those scales all slide around to make the same hazard category in different ways. It’s a continuous model and those categories are all bins.\\n\\nAnd I’d sort of return to my flood example. I would hesitate to hang to much chewable predictions on fire as they’re so meaningless. Fire is the least predictable of all of these tragedies…a spark is chance, the prevailing weather is chance, the urban fuel models that result from building, to which you most want to speak to, is completely chance. The later is the real problem. They’re pretty good at modeling wildland fire….but once it’s urban it’s impossible to know.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'It wasn’t long after wildfires erupted across Southern California that donations began pouring into a small office near Dodger Stadium.\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio wanted to give. So did the Dodgers, the Lakers, Netflix and a Las Vegas casino.\\n\\nThe object of their largesse was an obscure nonprofit called the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation which, for the better part of two decades, had quietly helped firefighters by raising funds for equipment — often things as nominal as gloves and flashlights — not covered in the city budget.\\n\\nAfter years of averaging less than $3 million a year in donations, the group received about $20 million in a matter of days.\\n\\nMoney came so fast, in such large chunks, that foundation President Liz Lin could not be sure of the exact total during a recent interview. “Absolutely overwhelming,” she said.\\n\\nNow she and her staff are working the phones, looking for a supplier who can fill rush orders for hand tools, hydration packs and fire shelters — silvery blankets that protect firefighters overrun by flames. They have received a request for hundreds of headlamps.\\n\\n“There are just so many things they help with,” Delia Ibarra, former president of the civilian Los Angeles Fire Commission, said of the foundation. “To me, they are gold.”\\n\\nThe fire department’s need for such generosity has become a subject of debate, pitting Mayor Karen Bass against billionaire Elon Musk, drawing the fire chief and other civic leaders into the fray.\\n\\nAs flames scorched thousands of acres in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, there were reports that Bass had cut the fire department’s budget by 2.7% for 2024-25.\\n\\nIn fact, when ongoing negotiations with the firefighters union concluded several months after that budget went into effect, an additional $53 million in salary raises and $58 million for new firetrucks were approved, increasing the operating budget by more than 7% compared with the prior fiscal year, according to city financial analysts.\\n\\n \\nRegardless, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley complained about not having enough money. Musk and Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong criticized city officials on social media. Lin and her foundation have tried to distance themselves from the controversy.\\n\\n“We don’t want to get into the political nuances,” she said. “We just ask [the firefighters], ‘What do you need? Give me a cost.’ ”\\n\\nHer foundation dates back to 2010, when local business owners visited a station house that did not have a washing machine capable of cleaning the toxins from heavy turnout coats. They discovered the vast majority of the department’s budget goes to salaries, leaving a relatively minuscule amount for equipment and specialized training. Individual stations were holding pancake breakfasts to raise money.\\n\\nEstablishing itself as a 501(c)(3) organization, the new group signed an agreement with the city to become a recognized fundraiser and developed a process by which department leadership and stations could apply for help.\\n\\nDonations totaled about $500,000 annually at first, enough to pay for computer equipment, some of those special washing machines and several thousand flashlights. If a station’s refrigerator broke down and the budget had no money for a new one, the foundation stepped in.\\n\\nFiremen often “have to do repairs at the stations themselves,” Ibarra said. “Sometimes they are fixing stuff out of their own pocket because it’s easier than putting in a request [to the city].”\\n\\nBy 2017, the foundation was attracting more than $1 million annually, a figure that would continue to grow. Lin took over from the previous president the following year, just before the Woolsey fire burned nearly 100,000 acres in L.A. and Ventura counties.\\n\\n“Woolsey was my training camp,” she said. “I had to understand the mechanics, the processes, what happens.”\\n\\nWhen a 2020 explosion injured 11 firefighters, the department requested a $277,000 Thermite RS3 robot that could remotely explore engulfed buildings. Two years later, it needed to replace an aging helicopter.\\n\\nThe foundation, which raised almost $6 million that year, spent about half that amount for a new Bell 505. Other gifts have included specialized training courses, mental health services and veterinary care for search-and-rescue dogs.\\n\\n“It’s a process we never had before,” LAFD spokesperson Margaret Stewart, a 19-year veteran, said. “Those were needs that were not met.”\\n\\nIn the world of charities, where local organizations such as the J. Paul Getty Trust and the California Endowment have assets in the billions, the foundation remains comparatively modest. Its paid staff of five works from a rent-free office at the department’s Frank Hotchkin Memorial Training Center beside Chavez Ravine.\\n\\nCharity Navigator, a watchdog organization, gives the group a four-star rating and reports that 93 cents of each $1 contribution goes to firefighters. This matters because a similar L.A. nonprofit devoted to county firefighters recently disbanded after facing allegations it had misused funds.\\n\\nIbarra said of the city foundation: “If you give money to them, firefighters are going to get that money.”\\n\\nSome quick thinking has now greatly expanded the pot. Soon after the Palisades fire broke out, Lin told her staff: “Let’s get something out on social media.” The money came rolling in.\\n\\nIn coming weeks, as the wildfires subside, she will meet with department leaders to discuss future purchases that might better prepare firefighters for the next emergency. Lin said: “When I walked down the hall this morning, leaving the operations center, I had four people stop me and say, ‘Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think of that?’ ”\\n\\nWith a department so large, serving a city so vast, the wish list seems never-ending.\\n\\nThose heavy-duty washing machines, the ones that started all of this? The foundation has patiently bought a few at a time — in between more-pressing needs — working down the list of 106 stations. Fifteen years later, Lin says, there are 10 more to go.',\n",

The key thing taking that long being of course, the rebuilding of a house/dwelling - the lengthy period partially being because of the insurance fire policy claims&funding process, but there are other long-standing issues too, like medical. In other words, the people displaced by fires will be in need of help for some time. At least a year, but likely more. Many of the orgs/funds listed in Taylor’s statement, and others that are similar and who provide direct aid in crisis not uncommonly struggle to raise money/ replenish these disaster funds outside of crisis periods. I don’t know how much money these funds have to allocate for aid to victims of the wildfires at the moment, but for sure, a guarantee that more funds are coming is not bad and could even be helpful if it comes at a time when the high volume of smaller donations for this disaster have dried up, and when Taylor’s donations have been used (but trust me when I say she is not the only super rich person who has donated a large amount right now, many could be doing it/ have done it anonymously, that is very standard).

Maybe if they were all built like that it would have mitigated the problem, but the interiors of houses are always somewhat flammable no matter what you do, and even those robust houses couldn't survive being completely surrounded.  It's kind of weird though typing it out because in the same paragraph I said pine trees can survive but metal and concrete houses can't.  But... that's what I saw.  Actually the very house I am describing with a metal roof and concrete walls that was in my parents neighborhood had a partially built back house they were working on that was literally just two by four wood framing, and it survived while their house did not.

In the case of the [Malibu fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/california-wildfire-malibu-pepperdine-university) that broke out last night, our reporter looked at why Pepperdine University students were told to stay put despite residents being told to evacuate. \\n\\n\"Escape routes from the school would require quick navigation of winding canyon roads that can become chaotic and congested during evacuations. In previous fires, traffic jams slowed egress to a crawl, and some spent hours trying to leave the area.\\n\\nInstead, the school has\\xa0invested in fire-proofing its buildings and landscaping\\xa0rather than encouraging the roughly 7,600 students, many without vehicles, to enter the fray.\"\\n\\nThe tactic hasn’t been without its criticism, however.

Officials say it’s because if a wildfire did break out in the area, it would be difficult to evacuate the roughly 8,000 residents through the two-lane, high-traffic commuter route.\\n\\n**Why it's closed:**\\xa0Jennifer Seetoo, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department captain of the Malibu/Lost Hills Station, told LAist that the closure may be inconvenient for those who rely on the road, but it could save lives when we have “hellacious” winds that may cast embers miles in front of a fire.\\n\\n“One major road in and out of Topanga — we want to make sure that we keep it residents only to make sure that we can evacuate as \\\\[fast\\\\] as we can,” she said.\\n\\n**The backstory:**\\xa0These preparedness closures are new — it became a best practice after the devastating 2018 Woolsey Fire.\\n\\nKevin McGowan, the director of L.A. County’s Office of Emergency Management, told LAist part of the fire’s after-action response was identifying high-risk areas that have a larger population, just like Topanga Canyon. He added that officials don’t take these decisions lightly.\\n\\n“\\u200aFires move with more severity, and more speed, and they have caused worse outcomes than we've seen in those years past,” he said. “So the response in this\\xa0[preparedness](https://ready.lacounty.gov/)\\xa0phase had to change to meet that moment.”\\n\\n**What's next:**\\xa0The closures come during red flag warnings, which Seetoo said we see approximately nine days out of the year. If wet weather arrives, we could also see closures for flooding or landslides.\",\n",
