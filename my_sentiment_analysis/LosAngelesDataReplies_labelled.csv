I think we need a serious conversation about the role of home insurance, though. Private insurance is a bad model for healthcare because healthcare can be very random as it is influenced by things out of your control, like your genetic baggage. However, the home insurance market in California is broken by well-intended but bad regulations. We don't allow insurance companies to use climate models to put a price on the increased risk of insuring properties in fire areas. The risk is very real, as we've seen with these recent fires, or in Paradise and Santa Rosa. It's not sustainable, but because insurance companies can't price in risk appropriately, they then jack up the premiums for everyone, even if they are not in a fire area. It's the equivalent of car insurance trying to charge the same for someone who drives a Corolla, and someone who drives a Porsche. Between Prop 103, which distorted our home insurance market, and prop 13, younger people with who tend to have fewer means are subsidizing the older residents who tend to be wealthier and live in the foothills.

Not to mention, sprawl in the foothills is bad for the environment. Make it more expensive via a fair home insurance price, and you'll see less of it.",01-15-2025,1,1,1,0,0,

"A “dangerously fast” wildfire fanned by hurricane-strength winds was burning out of control near Los Angeles on Wednesday, with thousands of residents ordered to evacuate and some taken to the hospital.

Multiple large homes were destroyed as the fire tore through neighbourhoods, blanketing a huge area in thick smoke.

Fierce gusts up to 80 miles p/h (130 kilometres) were fuelling flames that were scorching through farmland.

The mountain fire was reported near Moorpark, 40 miles north-west of Los Angeles, on Wednesday morning.

By afternoon it had exploded to 10,400 acres (4,200 hectares), Ventura County Fire Department said, and flames had reached a suburb of Camarillo, home to around 70,000 people.

Local broadcasters showed luxury homes in the Camarillo Heights area engulfed in flames, many utterly destroyed.

Further up the hillsides, aerial footage showed people frantically loading horses into trailers at sprawling ranch properties as swirling flames loomed nearby.

“It’s bad out there, but we’re getting them all out,” one woman told local broadcaster KTLA as she drove horses out of the area.

“(The fire) was surrounding on both sides... It’s just all over the place. It’s not one clear fire line. It’s everywhere.”

Firefighters had no official figures for the number of properties affected by the blaze, with conditions on the ground too dangerous to allow damage assessment.

There was no immediate figure for the number of people hurt, but officials said some had been taken to the hospital.

Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said the rapidly spreading blaze was entirely uncontained, with firefighters rushing to get people out of the way of the fire, which was casting embers as far as 2.5 miles (4 kilometres).

“Every helicopter, every fixed wing aircraft, everything we’ve been able to get a hold of is here fighting this fire, and it is moving at a dangerous rate,” he told reporters.

“Bushes are burning, grass is burning, hedgerows are burning, agricultural fields are burning, and structures are burning.

“This fire is moving dangerously fast.”

Now, when you start rebuilding, you will likely be required to take out a carriage insurance policy on the worksite. Additionally,  if you are getting housing assistance, you will likely be required to take out renters insurance  as well.

Yea the work is hard and they are not paid well, but remember that what is considered a ""light"" sentence for crime is performing community service, which is not paid at all.  In the end, society as a whole is paying for these inmates actions, whether it be from the lives who they had affected to get there, or the daily housing, education, security, and meals that the inmates receive.  This is one way for them to pay society back and I support their reintegration into society.

#Apartment/Deposit Scams
Lots of displaced people are out there who will be preyed on by this filth. They'll post ads for apartments that aren't for rent and take your deposit.  When you show up, it's occupied. It's never been for rent. Do your best to scope the possible apartment IN PERSON, like show up and figure out what SPECIFIC unit is for rent. Do not rent sight-unseen if you can avoid it. Ask friends to help you visit potential places for you in-person if you can't do it yourself.

#Real Estate Durress Scams
Assholes are going to approach anyone with damage and claim to want to buy their homes from them. They're not going to offer you reasonable value, and many of the outfits operating in this space are shady AF. ASK A REAL ESTATE LAWYER AND A FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO REVIEW ANYTHING before you transfer or sell your property. These vultures use desperation and anxiety to fuck over victims of tragedies.

"Hm, I agree with the general point (that LA *City* Fire needs permanent wildland hand crews), but I have a few gripes with how it's written.

It doesn't clarify until a bit later on the different jurisdictions, and even then not fully. LA *County* Fire has a whole slew of hand crews. As, obviously, does CalFire, which has jurisdiction over the whole state. Several times it references ""LA"" without specifying whether referencing LA City Fire or LA County Fire or colloqually just the general metropolitan area (usually LA City Fire, but still, sloppy writing).

I don't think it's unusual for a city FD to rely on larger fire jurisdictions (e.g. county, CalFire, or USFS) for hand crews, since most wildland tends to be in unincorporated areas. That said, given the large wildlands even within LA city administrative boundaries, particularly the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains, I generally do agree LA City should have at least a few permanent units. 

This weakness would've made no difference with the Palisades Fire. Everyone was on alert due to the extreme red flag warnings. LA County Fire had hand crews ready in Malibu, and CalFire was mobilized in preparation as well. Once the fire started, hand crews from LA County were on the scene, and within the day, tons of hand crews from various different fire agencies. (And just to be clear, this would have zero to do with the Eaton Fire, since that's out of LA city admin boundaries.)

(And calling the section detailing Palisades Fire ""Shorthanded"" seems entirely misleading considering they even detail how many hand crews were on the scene that day. Ultimately they had to pull back because of extreme winds making things dangerous, not lack of manpower.)

In general, its good that these recent fires are putting eyes on whether our fire fighting units are properly resourced. But what LA City needs hand crews for are going to be for days without major red flag warnings, where CalFire isn't necessarily pre-positioned in the area, and so they don't always have to rely on LA County Fire to help out on more ""minor"" brush fires within their jurisdiction. (Heavy caveat on minor not necessarily meaning any less dangerous. But just that any ""major"" wildfire, it's basically just a given that LA County [at the very least, if not also CalFire and/or USFS] will also be involved.)",01-18-2025,0,0,0,0,0,

Article: In October, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed Executive Directive No. 9, which established a citywide capital infrastructure plan.

The directive was a breakthrough for Los Angeles and a demonstration of poor governance: Such capital plans — which outline priorities and strategies for building infrastructure — are commonplace in local governments. But Los Angeles, a peculiar island in the world of governance, did not have one.

I mention Bass’ directive not to exonerate from her current political crisis nor to take a side in the bitter battle over responsibility for this month’s fires.

Instead, I wish to emphasize that the big controversy over the fires’ causes — faulty hydrants, dry reservoirs, prepositioning of fire engines or lack of personnel — is way too small.  
Los Angeles, buffeted by disaster, needs to argue about a bigger challenge: How and whether the city government, after a half-century of shirking basic responsibilities, might start governing itself again. 
If L.A. decides to get serious, it will be starting near the bottom. The city, which includes Pacific Palisades, doesn’t have a comprehensive catalog of its infrastructure or a plan for maintaining it. It’s a city that tolerates three water main breaks a day and disintegrating streets. It’s a city with a backlog of sidewalk repairs that would take years to process.

Even worse, it’s a city that has all but given up on planning. In California, cities are required by law to make and update general plans, covering elements from conservation to public safety. But L.A.’s official planning documents are mostly out of date. Despite some recent updating work, the community plans — which are part of the city’s land use plan — date to the 1990s. A few city plans — for facilities and infrastructure — are more than 50 years old.

Planning is about imagining a future. A city that doesn’t plan is a city that doesn’t tap its collective imagination. And that’s the bitter irony behind these tragic fires. Los Angeles, a city world-famous for imagination, experienced a monumental failure of imagination.

I mean, how could a city that produced films of itself destroyed by so many unusual disasters — tidal waves, ice storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, zombies, infections, sharknados and a 50-foot-tall woman — not have been ready for an epic fire?

The lame excuses by Mayor Bass and Los Angeles fire officials — that the fire that destroyed Pacific Palisades was faster and stronger than any they could fight — are confessions of this failure.  And they should have imagined this blaze — more powerful fires had recently destroyed other parts of California. City fire Chief Kristin Cowley admitted on TV that larger fire emergencies “demand an expansion of our life-safety service capabilities.”

Why didn’t L.A. make plans equal to its challenges?

One answer is corruption. The real estate developers and public employee unions that dominate city governments don’t want to be constrained by plans; they prefer to use their power to negotiate special deals with elected officials. And elected officials like the freedom to make ad hoc decisions about developments in their own districts. This sort of decision-making often runs on a pay-to-play system. Those who have power or money get what they want. And the City Council members get donations or, worse, illegal favors. This is why federal prosecutors have spent recent years bringing charges against so many city officials.

Mayor Bass could have changed this system after she took office in 2022. She could have revamped the City Council, cleaned out the 1980s-style city bureaucracy or asked voters to rewrite the city charter, L.A.’s constitution. Instead, she offered up only minor changes to the charter in last year’s elections and emphasized collaboration within the existing system.",01-27-2025,0,1,0,0,0,

"It wasn’t long after wildfires erupted across Southern California that donations began pouring into a small office near Dodger Stadium.

Leonardo DiCaprio wanted to give. So did the Dodgers, the Lakers, Netflix and a Las Vegas casino.

The object of their largesse was an obscure nonprofit called the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation which, for the better part of two decades, had quietly helped firefighters by raising funds for equipment — often things as nominal as gloves and flashlights — not covered in the city budget.

After years of averaging less than $3 million a year in donations, the group received about $20 million in a matter of days.

Money came so fast, in such large chunks, that foundation President Liz Lin could not be sure of the exact total during a recent interview. “Absolutely overwhelming,” she said.

Now she and her staff are working the phones, looking for a supplier who can fill rush orders for hand tools, hydration packs and fire shelters — silvery blankets that protect firefighters overrun by flames. They have received a request for hundreds of headlamps.

“There are just so many things they help with,” Delia Ibarra, former president of the civilian Los Angeles Fire Commission, said of the foundation. “To me, they are gold.”

The fire department’s need for such generosity has become a subject of debate, pitting Mayor Karen Bass against billionaire Elon Musk, drawing the fire chief and other civic leaders into the fray.

As flames scorched thousands of acres in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, there were reports that Bass had cut the fire department’s budget by 2.7% for 2024-25.

In fact, when ongoing negotiations with the firefighters union concluded several months after that budget went into effect, an additional $53 million in salary raises and $58 million for new firetrucks were approved, increasing the operating budget by more than 7% compared with the prior fiscal year, according to city financial analysts.

 
Regardless, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley complained about not having enough money. Musk and Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong criticized city officials on social media. Lin and her foundation have tried to distance themselves from the controversy.

“We don’t want to get into the political nuances,” she said. “We just ask [the firefighters], ‘What do you need? Give me a cost.’ ”

Her foundation dates back to 2010, when local business owners visited a station house that did not have a washing machine capable of cleaning the toxins from heavy turnout coats. They discovered the vast majority of the department’s budget goes to salaries, leaving a relatively minuscule amount for equipment and specialized training. Individual stations were holding pancake breakfasts to raise money.

Establishing itself as a 501(c)(3) organization, the new group signed an agreement with the city to become a recognized fundraiser and developed a process by which department leadership and stations could apply for help.

Donations totaled about $500,000 annually at first, enough to pay for computer equipment, some of those special washing machines and several thousand flashlights. If a station’s refrigerator broke down and the budget had no money for a new one, the foundation stepped in.

Firemen often “have to do repairs at the stations themselves,” Ibarra said. “Sometimes they are fixing stuff out of their own pocket because it’s easier than putting in a request [to the city].”

By 2017, the foundation was attracting more than $1 million annually, a figure that would continue to grow. Lin took over from the previous president the following year, just before the Woolsey fire burned nearly 100,000 acres in L.A. and Ventura counties.

“Woolsey was my training camp,” she said. “I had to understand the mechanics, the processes, what happens.”

When a 2020 explosion injured 11 firefighters, the department requested a $277,000 Thermite RS3 robot that could remotely explore engulfed buildings. Two years later, it needed to replace an aging helicopter.

The foundation, which raised almost $6 million that year, spent about half that amount for a new Bell 505. Other gifts have included specialized training courses, mental health services and veterinary care for search-and-rescue dogs.

“It’s a process we never had before,” LAFD spokesperson Margaret Stewart, a 19-year veteran, said. “Those were needs that were not met.”

In the world of charities, where local organizations such as the J. Paul Getty Trust and the California Endowment have assets in the billions, the foundation remains comparatively modest. Its paid staff of five works from a rent-free office at the department’s Frank Hotchkin Memorial Training Center beside Chavez Ravine.

Charity Navigator, a watchdog organization, gives the group a four-star rating and reports that 93 cents of each $1 contribution goes to firefighters. This matters because a similar L.A. nonprofit devoted to county firefighters recently disbanded after facing allegations it had misused funds.

Ibarra said of the city foundation: “If you give money to them, firefighters are going to get that money.”

Some quick thinking has now greatly expanded the pot. Soon after the Palisades fire broke out, Lin told her staff: “Let’s get something out on social media.” The money came rolling in.

In coming weeks, as the wildfires subside, she will meet with department leaders to discuss future purchases that might better prepare firefighters for the next emergency. Lin said: “When I walked down the hall this morning, leaving the operations center, I had four people stop me and say, ‘Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think of that?’ ”

With a department so large, serving a city so vast, the wish list seems never-ending.

Those heavy-duty washing machines, the ones that started all of this? The foundation has patiently bought a few at a time — in between more-pressing needs — working down the list of 106 stations. Fifteen years later, Lin says, there are 10 more to go.",01-20-2025,0,1,0,0,0,

"Article is kinda feel good click bait to be honest. It wasn't ""birthed"" from the Civil Rights era, it was one of the few suburban areas Black families were allowed to live in due to racist redlining all throughout LA county. [Black families who were already living in Pasadena, were forced out of Pasadena and into by local government officials](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c72eba7de6bd4c6aa63286e82963d0f8)

>But for thousands of Black Pasadena residents during the mid-20th century, the venerated stadium was something else entirely. The protection of the stadium and its natural surroundings became part of the City of Pasadena and state freeway planners’ justification to upend Black neighborhoods. 

>In the 1950s and ‘60s, planners and other local officials built upon decades of disinvestment, redlining, and urban renewal projects to push a new route of the Foothill Freeway/Interstate 210 through the northwest neighborhoods of Pasadena, resulting in the displacement of nearly 3,000 predominantly Black residents. An alternate route — running largely through uninhabited parkland along the eastern edge of the Arroyo Seco valley by the Rose Bowl stadium parking lot — was rejected.

>But as covenants and other blunt tools of racial oppression were ruled illegal, local officials turned to less overt but no less effective methods of displacement: neighborhood demolition and rebuilding projects best known as “urban renewal.” These neighborhoods, fondly remembered by their residents, were labeled as blighted by the city in its 1962 General Plan. It was no coincidence that northwest Pasadena and other neighborhoods around it were the same that were “redlined” by the federal mortgage evaluators HOLC in the 1930s. They were the neighborhoods where Black Pasadenans lived. 

>The city followed this same circular logic to determine the siting of the Foothill Freeway. After the planners and the local officials debated between a handful of alternatives, the “Green route” — which drove right through the neighborhoods with majority residents of color — was ultimately selected because it fit best with the City’s General Plan. The General Plan, of course, was informed by the HOLC maps, which were themselves largely products of the racial make-up of the city at the time. It is hard to interpret this series of events as anything other than a coordinated effort by local officials over decades to displace Black residents.

These benefits may also be available to people who were previously ineligible for CalFresh, including college students, undocumented residents and unaided foster care children.

Check out full eligibility guidelines from [L.A. County’s Department of Public Social Services](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/food.html).

**What are the benefits?** A family of four with a monthly income up to $3,529 may be eligible to receive $975 in temporary food assistance.

**Why now?** The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved California’s request for CalFresh benefits to enhance fire recovery efforts — one month after wildfires erupted in L.A. County.

**How to apply:** The application period is open until Feb. 19.

You can apply via phone by calling (866) 488-8482 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. You can also apply in-person at any Department of Public Social Services [office location](https://dpss.lacounty.gov/en/resources/offices.html) between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.

If approved, L.A. County officials will tell you when and where to pick up an EBT card, which can be used to buy food at grocery stores and other retailers.",02-11-2025,0,0,0,0,0,

"**Topline:**

>There are no state laws or regulations that mandate specific cleaning or testing before schools located near wildfires can reopen. Instead, schools must interpret guidance from multiple local, state and federal agencies and that information has not reached all parents.

**Frustrated families:** Andrew Ferrone is the parent of two children who attend Canyon Charter Elementary School, a school in Santa Monica that remained closed as of Friday. “We increasingly hear that the return to school is imminent,” Ferrone said. “But we have very little visibility into exactly the protocols that have been taken and any level of assurance that our kids will be safe.”

**Limited guidelines:** “When to reoccupy a school is ultimately a local decision, made by the district and their respective public health department since each county may have different recommendations for air quality,” California Department of Education spokesman Scott Roark wrote in an email.

**The risk:** The smoke and ash from wildfires create dangerous air quality, especially for sensitive groups that include children and pregnant people. Tiny particles can get into the lungs and cause health issues ranging from bronchitis to cancer. The fires can also release chemicals from plastics, lead, asbestos and other toxic substances.

**Best practices:** All ash should be removed before students return to campus. Guidelines for cleaning include wiping down surfaces with mild detergents and vacuuming with machines equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.",01-27-2025,0,0,0,0,0,

"As first responders work to save human lives and property, fisheries managers are considering a potential rescue plan for the steelhead trout in Topanga Creek.

The Palisades Fire that has been burning for a week in Los Angeles County is only 14 percent contained as of Tuesday, and high winds in the forecast could make matters worse. Officials are already expecting the blaze to rank among the costliest wildfires in U.S. history. And while human health and safety remain the top concerns, state fisheries managers are also warning that the fire could devastate the last known steelhead run in the Santa Monica mountains. Topanga Creek, which flows into the Pacific Ocean between Malibu and Los Angeles, contains the only remaining spawning habitat for steelhead trout in the Southern California mountain range. The small coastal creek has also been completely scorched over the last week.

While the streams of the Santa Monicas were historically rich in Pacific salmon and steelhead, a host of dams built during the 20th century cut off access to most of these river systems. Topanga is now the only creek in the area where rainbow trout can freely swim to the ocean and back. As such, it’s one of the last strongholds for Southern California steelhead trout, a unique and increasingly rare subspecies of steelhead that was listed as endangered in 2024.",01-14-2025,0,0,0,0,0,

"Key Points from the article

	1.	Increasing Use of Plastics in Urban Development
	•	Modern homes and buildings rely heavily on plastic materials, such as polyester fabrics, polyurethane foam, and vinyl flooring.
	•	These synthetic materials are cheaper and more efficient but significantly increase fire hazards.
	2.	Fire Behavior with Plastic Materials
	•	Fires involving plastic burn hotter and spread faster compared to those with natural materials.
	•	In tests, rooms with plastic-based furnishings reached flashover (when a fire becomes uncontrollable) in under five minutes, compared to over 30 minutes for natural materials.
	3.	Toxic Emissions from Plastic Fires
	•	When burning, plastics release highly toxic gases, including:
	•	Hydrogen cyanide: A deadly gas that impairs oxygen delivery in the body.
	•	Hydrochloric acid: A respiratory irritant that damages the lungs.
	•	Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): Harmful chemicals contributing to indoor air pollution.
	4.	Health Risks from Smoke Inhalation
	•	The smoke from plastic fires contains fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into the lungs.
	•	Exposure to these pollutants is linked to:
	•	Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
	•	Cognitive impairments.
	•	Risks to pregnant women, including low birth weight and preterm birth.
	5.	Challenges for Urban Areas Like Los Angeles
	•	Densely populated cities with heavy use of synthetic materials face greater risks of devastating fires.
	•	The rapid fire spread and toxic smoke hinder firefighting efforts and threaten both firefighters and residents.
	6.	Broader Implications
	•	As cities become more reliant on plastic materials, the risks of urban fires grow.
	•	Greater public awareness and consideration of fire-resistant, natural alternatives are critical for reducing hazards.",01-16-2025,0,0,0,0,0,

">Topanga Canyon Boulevard is [closed](https://x.com/CaltransDist7/status/1868817999937126647) until 6 p.m. Wednesday, with only residents and local businesses allowed to travel through. Officials say it’s because if a wildfire did break out in the area, it would be difficult to evacuate the roughly 8,000 residents through the two-lane, high-traffic commuter route.

**Why it's closed:** Jennifer Seetoo, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department captain of the Malibu/Lost Hills Station, told LAist that the closure may be inconvenient for those who rely on the road, but it could save lives when we have “hellacious” winds that may cast embers miles in front of a fire.

“One major road in and out of Topanga — we want to make sure that we keep it residents only to make sure that we can evacuate as \[fast\] as we can,” she said.

**The backstory:** These preparedness closures are new — it became a best practice after the devastating 2018 Woolsey Fire.

Kevin McGowan, the director of L.A. County’s Office of Emergency Management, told LAist part of the fire’s after-action response was identifying high-risk areas that have a larger population, just like Topanga Canyon. He added that officials don’t take these decisions lightly.

“ Fires move with more severity, and more speed, and they have caused worse outcomes than we've seen in those years past,” he said. “So the response in this [preparedness](https://ready.lacounty.gov/) phase had to change to meet that moment.”

**What's next:** The closures come during red flag warnings, which Seetoo said we see approximately nine days out of the year. If wet weather arrives, we could also see closures for flooding or landslides.",12-18-2024,0,0,0,0,0,
