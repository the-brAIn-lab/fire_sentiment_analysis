Murdoch New Corp companies are running a full court press with the intent of setting the table that LA fires were only due to Democratic incompetence.  Not climate conditions, but democrats.

Musk of course is using Twitter/x to heavily promote recall efforts a/g Newsom and Bass.  The goal of course is to ultimately flip CA red even if the recall fails, this is all about propaganda. The same way ""immigrants eat the dogs"" worked.

Why the push to flip CA state Gov position red?

It's important to understand this is bigger for Trump and Musk than just getting more votes for the GOP in the House of Reps.

CA has a great deal of natural resources waiting to be raped, er, sold to the highest bidder by Trump. Fed environmental restrictions and monitoring will undoubtably be cut under Trump but CA environmental regs and monitoring is usually stricter than Feds.

So get rid of the Dems running California will let the oligarchs do what they want. If they can't flip the CA legis but can control the Gov that would at least allow a Trumpie Gov to appoint Trumpie judgs in CA and Trumpie regulators to be appointed to various oversight commissions.

And what about the water?

The largest concentration of lithium deposits in the world lies under the California Salton Sea. Estimated worth at least half a TRILLION dollars. This lithium is critical to make car batteries for EVs like Teslas.

Once production gets a big green light, there likely isn't enough water from the Colorado river to handle extraction/production. That's where the whole ""California doesn't have enough water to water the Southern California forests"" BS comes in.

The water grab from Northern California isn't about fighting wildfires. Trump and Musk could give a damn about them. Or fire victims-except using them as pawns.  The water is for development and fracking and mining.

"I take issue with the last one:

> **More brush clearance could have helped prevent the Palisades Fire, why wasn‚Äôt it done?**

> Even if the excess vegetation was cleared, there was no stopping the powerful winds that fueled the spread of the wildfires. The winds could cast embers more than a mile away, making containing the spread impossible, my colleague Jacob Margolis writes.

It's preventative measure that also helps mitigate. This was a clear deflection by LAist, not a debunking. When you have a week to prepare for a wind event, you clear the brush and also use that time to identify the high risk areas and move resources closer. 

If you've lived in LA for over 20 years, you already thought this was being done every time because it usually was. We deserve a real answer as to why this didn't happen so we can prevent that mistake from ever happening again. 

Having more life boats on the Titanic wouldn't prevent it from sinking after it hit an iceberg but sure would have done a lot in terms of saving lives. This deflection from LAist is basically them saying ""Even if we had more life boats, the Titanic would still hit an iceberg and people will die"". 

Saying that clearing brush wouldn't change anything is insulting to everyone that experienced a loss. If it could help even 1% and your house burned down, you want a god damn answer to this question.",1/14/25,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the case of the [Malibu fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/california-wildfire-malibu-pepperdine-university) that broke out last night, our reporter looked at why Pepperdine University students were told to stay put despite residents being told to evacuate. 

""Escape routes from the school would require quick navigation of winding canyon roads that can become chaotic and congested during evacuations. In previous fires, traffic jams slowed egress to a crawl, and some spent hours trying to leave the area.

Instead, the school has¬†invested in fire-proofing its buildings and landscaping¬†rather than encouraging the roughly 7,600 students, many without vehicles, to enter the fray.""

"well written perspective as the detials start to become clear we can see that major Bass did infact receive warnings about the imminent danger of the fires as detailed in this NYTimes article

""By Thursday last week, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles had begun¬†[warning](https://x.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1875005817050853819)¬†of ‚Äúextreme fire weather conditions.‚Äù By Sunday, the warnings had become even more dire ‚Äî ‚Äúrapid fire growth and extreme behavior with any fire starts.‚Äù

But Mayor Bass posted her first warning on X about the wind storm on Monday, when she was already in Ghana. Her office did not send out a news release about fire risk until nearly 11 a.m. on Tuesday morning, after the blaze in Pacific Palisades had already broken out.

‚ÄúThere was zero preparation. There was zero thought here,‚Äù said Michael Gonzales, 47, whose home burned down in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy neighborhood that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. His family of five was camped out in a hotel in Santa Monica on Wednesday as they began figuring out where they will live. ""

"More from Didion:

>I recall James Taylor singing over and over on the news radio station between updates on the 1978 Mandeville and Kanan fires, both of which started on October 23rd of that year, and which could be seen burning toward each other‚Äîsystematically wiping out large parts of Malibu and Pacific Palisades‚Äîfrom an upstairs window of my house in Brentwood. It was said then that the Kanan fire was burning on a twenty-mile front and had already jumped the Pacific Coast Highway at Trancas Canyon. The stand in the Mandeville fire, it was said, would be made at Sunset Boulevard. I stood at the window and watched a house on a hill above Sunset implode, its oxygen sucked out by the force of the fire.

>Some thirty-four thousand acres of Los Angeles County burned that week in 1978. More than eighty thousand acres had burned in 1968. Close to a hundred and thirty thousand acres had burned in 1970. Seventy-four thousand and some had burned in 1975, sixty-some thousand would burn in 1979. Forty-six thousand would burn in 1980, forty-five thousand in 1982. In the hills behind Malibu, where the moist air off the Pacific makes the brush grow fast, it takes about twelve years before a burn is ready to burn again. Inland, where the manzanita and sumac and chamise that make up the native brush in Southern California grow more slowly (the wild mustard that turns the hills a translucent yellow after rain is not native but exotic, introduced in the nineteen-twenties in an effort to reseed burns), regrowth takes from fifteen to twenty years. Since 1919, when the county began keeping records of its fires, some areas have burned eight times.

>In other words, there is nothing unusual about fires in Los Angeles, which is, after all, a desert city with only two distinct seasons: one beginning in January and lasting three or four months, during which storms come in from the northern Pacific and it rains‚Äîoften an inch every two or three hours, and sometimes, in some places, an inch a minute‚Äîand one lasting eight or nine months, during which it burns, or gets ready to burn. What was unusual this year, after two years of drought and a third year of less than average rainfall, was that it was ready to burn while the June fogs still lay on the coastline. On the first of May, months earlier than ever before, the California Department of Forestry declared the start of the fire season and began hiring extra crews. By the last week in June, there had been more than two thousand brush and forest fires in California. Three hundred and twenty of them were burning that week alone.
