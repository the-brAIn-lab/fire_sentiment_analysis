I hope it's as good as it sounds and I also hope there are regulations in place to require new builds to use it if it works.  From my perspective (I was actively fighting fires near Lincoln and Woodbury) the buildings themselves were the worst problem of all, far worse than trees and debris.  The thing is, I also know of houses that had metal roofing and concrete walls that burned down.  Maybe if they were all built like that it would have mitigated the problem, but the interiors of houses are always somewhat flammable no matter what you do, and even those robust houses couldn't survive being completely surrounded.  It's kind of weird though typing it out because in the same paragraph I said pine trees can survive but metal and concrete houses can't.  But... that's what I saw.  Actually the very house I am describing with a metal roof and concrete walls that was in my parents neighborhood had a partially built back house they were working on that was literally just two by four wood framing, and it survived while their house did not.  I guess all I can really say with certainty is there is an element of randomness to what burns and what doesn't that seems to not care too much about what building materials are used.  Enough heat and wind concentrated on a spot seems like it can take almost anything out.  I definitely want to see better materials used in the rebuild though.

"You can't simply declare ""people should choose to live somewhere else, then"" without a comprehensive plan for that ""somewhere else."" Otherwise you're pushing the responsibility for a ""societal concern"" onto individuals, which is ***even more unfair*** than pushing it onto a large corporate industry.

For example, a large group of the people who lost homes to the Eaton fire are employees at the Jet Propulsion Lab, a NASA facility worth probably tens or hundreds of billions of dollars that has been in Pasadena since the 1930s. If you work at JPL, you likely are going to live in a place with high fire risk because...those are the places near JPL. The stretch along the Angeles Crest mountains and the Verdugo hills, maybe down towards north central LA into the hills around Highland Park... it's all in the fire zone.

So what's your answer for these people if they ""aren't supposed to choose to live in a high risk zone""? Stop working for NASA and go somewhere else? Commute 1-2 hours from a lower-risk zone (that would immediately wind up overcrowded if everyone in a high risk zone in LA moved to low risk zones)? Move a hundred-billion dollar NASA facility to a place with no environmental risk?

It's so fucking easy to just say ""societal issue, just live somewhere else 'till society sorts it out."" But that really just smacks of a backhanded way to fuck over the small guys or just pile more Individual Responsibility (tm) onto people who are out doing good work for good reasons that we really need as a species (JPL is responsible for a slew of earth-based information satellites and airborne instruments that we rely on for knowledge of Earth conditions in addition to their space exploration stuff like mars rovers).",01-09-2025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It would be good to see verification that this is actually what happened, yes, but most importantly we need to know the timing and what the funds were for. Sounds like if the account Bloomenfield‚Äôs office gives is accurate then those funds were for raises for existing staff, which means that the cuts to staffing which are the source of controversy happened irregardless.

People focused excessively on the dollar amounts, which led to lots of posts here ‚Äúdebunking‚Äù the cuts because ‚Äúactually the budget increased by $53 million‚Äù. What actually matters are the material consequences of the budget allocation and the overall timeline.

What seems likely is that the budget cuts happened, which led to material changes (e.g. maybe a decline in staffing in certain departments) that the LAFD warned could impact its capabilities. The $53 million was then set aside for costs that are not as closely related to LAFD‚Äôs capabilities (eg raises for existing staff). 

You can raise issues here about the efficiency of the distribution of funds but my point is that there are real questions about whether or the LAFD is sufficiently funded in the context of those initial cuts and their consequences.

TLDR; the $53 million is being presented as undoing the $17 million in cuts, but this is not likely to be the case because the 53 million was earmarked for things other than what was impacted by the cuts. People need to stop just sharing these numbers as if they mean something by themselves and start talking specifics in terms of what actual resources or processes were hurt or helped by the most recent round of budgeting decisions.",01-10-2025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So? Incarceration is a government service provide to the public that we pay for. That service is to (a) deter people from committing crimes, (b) confine convicts to prevent them from committing crimes in the present, and (c) rehabilitate convicts so they don't commit crimes in the future. If you don't think that's worth paying $90k per inmate per year, then incarceration isn't serving its promised purpose, and so incarceration needs to be reformed so that the cost matches the benefit. If, for example, you want to charge inmates for rent and food because you think it's unfair that they get free room and board, then propose it. Good luck with that.

But none of that has anything to do with firefighting or compensation for firefighting. Firefighting is a service rendered by specialists, and those specialists should be paid commensurate with the services they render, whether they are incarcerated or not.

">Incarceration is a consequence of a person‚Äôs actions

Nope, it's a government service. You are paying for a government service to isolate and secure them in a prison. You can attach whatever moral judgments you want to it, but on a functional level, it is a transaction between the taxpayers and the government to provide a service.

If you no longer want to isolate them because you don't think the government service is providing the stated benefit to your satisfaction, then we can reform the carceral system to reduce costs, or abolish it entirely for a different system.

But that has nothing to do with the services the inmates themselves can provide as specialists. And firefighting is a specialty that deserves fair compensation. If you don't want them to be paid, then don't put them to work.

>They‚Äôre paying their debt to society for their offense against it.¬†

They are already paying for their ""debt to society"" by being isolated from it and having access to their loved ones limited, not to mention the lifelong consequences of being an ex-convict. Why would you muddy the waters by messing with other unrelated matters?

You are conflating incarceration with professional services. It's always a mistake to cross boundaries like that.

* Learning from international models that showcase effective fire prevention methodologies, such as those implemented in Germany.

>But for thousands of Black Pasadena residents during the mid-20th century, the venerated stadium was something else entirely. The protection of the stadium and its natural surroundings became part of the City of Pasadena and state freeway planners‚Äô justification to upend Black neighborhoods. 

>In the 1950s and ‚Äò60s, planners and other local officials built upon decades of disinvestment, redlining, and urban renewal projects to push a new route of the Foothill Freeway/Interstate 210 through the northwest neighborhoods of Pasadena, resulting in the displacement of nearly 3,000 predominantly Black residents. An alternate route ‚Äî running largely through uninhabited parkland along the eastern edge of the Arroyo Seco valley by the Rose Bowl stadium parking lot ‚Äî was rejected.

>But as covenants and other blunt tools of racial oppression were ruled illegal, local officials turned to less overt but no less effective methods of displacement: neighborhood demolition and rebuilding projects best known as ‚Äúurban renewal.‚Äù These neighborhoods, fondly remembered by their residents, were labeled as blighted by the city in its 1962 General Plan. It was no coincidence that northwest Pasadena and other neighborhoods around it were the same that were ‚Äúredlined‚Äù by the federal mortgage evaluators HOLC in the 1930s. They were the neighborhoods where Black Pasadenans lived. 

>The city followed this same circular logic to determine the siting of the Foothill Freeway. After the planners and the local officials debated between a handful of alternatives, the ‚ÄúGreen route‚Äù ‚Äî which drove right through the neighborhoods with majority residents of color ‚Äî was ultimately selected because it fit best with the City‚Äôs General Plan. The General Plan, of course, was informed by the HOLC maps, which were themselves largely products of the racial make-up of the city at the time. It is hard to interpret this series of events as anything other than a coordinated effort by local officials over decades to displace Black residents.
