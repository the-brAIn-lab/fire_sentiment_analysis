            "It's a disposal ceremony and the correct way to retire an American flag.\n\nBegin a Flag burning ceremony by folding the whole Flag in its\u00a0customary manner. Next, start a fire large enough to completely burn the Flag and respectfully place the Flag into the fire. The Flag should not touch the ground in the process.\n\nAs the Flag begins to burn, salute the flag, say the Pledge of Allegiance, and pause for a moment of silence. The Flag should be thoroughly burned so that nothing besides ashes are left. Finally, bury the ashes",

Then we get a nice little break, and the winter inversions start (not smoke, but air quality can be just as bad) PLUS we get the joys of slick icy roads that don\u2019t get plowed. \n\nIf it\u2019s really bothering you probably go see your doc and get an inhaler.\n\nETA: PS no, something somewhere will burn every summer.  We get smoke locally, and from Canada, Washington, ID, OR.  It collects in the valley.  About the time you think you should be in the clear the same mountain burns again.  Hellgate Canyon/ Sentinel burned a little this year. Some idiot sets the grassy side of sentinel on fire every 10 ish years, and the canyon was a rager in the mid 80s.",
            "It happens often, but it's not constant. We had a pretty good first half of the summer, so no complaints from me.\n Obviously, no smoke would be best, but that's just life here.\n\nIt's mostly a summer thing, so it will get better. Later we can get anxiety from the icy roads instead of the smoke.",
            "Big change in the weather coming Wednesday/Thursday, should knock the smoke back for awhile.",
            "The only way I\u2019ve been able to live here long-term with asthma was to invest in HEPA filters for every room in my house and limit outdoor activity when the AQI starts getting into the 80\u2019s. Think of smoke exposure as accumulative - the less you are exposed to over time the better, especially if you are sensitive.\u00a0",
            "Missoula has been rated one of the places with the worst air quality in the country. This is normal for here and will impact your health in the long term. Fire season goes from July until the first good snows in November.\n\nhttps://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2018-04-18/missoula-air-lands-on-list-of-most-polluted",
            "Lived in Missoula for 13 years - never had smoke stick around until December. With the changing climate, it is difficult to predict. I honestly kind of thought we skated by mostly unharmed this summer until this week. It could be done in a week, or if another fire starts, it may be a bit longer. I don\u2019t recall smoke in October so hopefully it\u2019ll be done soon. \n\nDo you wear a mask? They help immensely with the smoke and the effects of it. I highly recommend. People were wearing masks in the summer even before Covid here.",
            "Most times they do a \"let burn\" practice and wait for the fire to burn itself out. It really depends on the location and size of the fire how long it will last. But most (bad) years we've had fires, it does last pretty much all summer into fall till it gets colder. And forests will never completely burn up because they are plants and regrow. The new growth won't be as flammable and will grow lush. Rinse and repeat.",
            "Wood stove smoke  may also be a concern during the winter when inversions set in. Like mentioned above, a good quality mask may be a good investment.",
            "I've lived in other places, but they also dealt with wildfire smoke, and I wouldn't say missoula is the worst I've seen. I understand it can be jarring if you don't know what's going on, though.\n\nThere will be forest fire smoke every year because there are forest fires every year. That's natural, although obviously it has been exasperated by climate change. It doesn't help that smoke tends to get stuck in the valley, and we occasionally get smoke from as far away as oregon or even california. Last year was an unusually mild winter which made local wildfires much worse, which definitely isn't helping. \n\nBUT, it isn't constantly bad. Even if we have a warm fall (which I'm hoping we won't), there will be periods of relief where the smoke is much less thick or not here at all. I hope that's comforting \n\nI think your best bet is to figure out strategies that help you cope. Obviously staying indoors helps, but I get that's can make you go nuts. If you still have any masks from the pandemic lying around, those can actually help a lot. And while you can't be outside for long periods of time, maybe try looking at the many groups that meet at the library. Go to a movie (The Roxy is cheap). And because the valley traps so much smoke, there are times when the surrounding area has better air quality, so a drive out of town can help. \n\nBest of luck! This is a fact of life in the mountain west, but I get it can really hard to adjust to and people aren't always understanding.",
            "You'll be dealing with it all your life if you stay here..... Is it bad this year? Yeah, but it's gonna be shitty every summer no matter what. You can always count on fire season. If we don't get a lot of rain or run off, everything's dry and we have a bad fire season. If we have a ton of moisture and runoff, everything grows great then drys out and we have a worse fire season.... Regardless, no matter what, we always get shit on with smoke....",
            "Thanks everyone. I needed a dose of reality.",
            "If you have the means and the time, a quick 45 minute drive out of town can get you out of the smoke for a few hours and you can see clean skies and mountains",
            "Buy a good electric air purifier and if you can stand it, wear KN95 masks just like covid times. Good luck",
            "Cool weather and rain in the forecast this week.  If there\u2019s some winds with it too it\u2019ll really help with the air quality.  The smoke is pretty bad right now, some summers we have it for moths, others it\u2019s just a few weeks.  This year we\u2019ve had *relatively* good save the last few weeks",
            "Time to become a local and get out there, go for a run, ride your bike, hike the mountains. What? Do you want to live forever?\u00a0",
            "Exactly. 30 years from now, the forest that burned this year will be maturing and ready to burn again.",
            "It's also one of the worst cities of its size in the country for crime.\u00a0\n\n\nMiserable winters, smokey summers, and a good chance of being robbed. WTF do so many people want to move here ?",
            "Yea, get a good reusable n95, and buy air filters for your house\u00a0",
            "Thank you, I like your suggestions for things to do. Being stuck in a house with one\u2019s parents is a challenge. I\u2019m going to go to the library today.",
            "Um, I\u2019d call this a good year for smoke. It\u2019s been bad for only a few days in a row, clears up, and has rarely been worse than moderate\u00a0\n\nA bad year is 2-3 weeks of orange sun and literally no horizon.",
            "Great public transportation and bike infrastructure. World class outdoor recreation minutes from your door. Amazing college, vibrant arts and music scene. No traffic jams to speak of compared to commuting in a major city area. If you can work remotely, skipping town during the worst of fire season is an option. I\u2019ve only had very minor property crime experience; feel safe walking anywhere.",
            "Been here my whole life, I have never felt unsafe. I don't have a source on crime statistics but I'm calling bullshit here unless you can provide it.",

Asylums started letting people with severe schizophrenia and bipolar disorder out in droves... and wouldn't you know it... they stopped using or being able to afford their medication. Suddenly there's a huge influx of people who cannot deal with societal norms being pushed into the street. The opiate epidemic is another major cause, again started by poorly educated or negligent medicap professionals. This latest plague is due to property owners however. Driving the poor out because they want higher rent or using them as Airbnbs.",

Not to mention securing work and housing across the country.  It was totally worth it for me, but not everybody can do that.  Especially not when already living hand to mouth.\n\nSince leaving, I have recognized I will probably never be able to afford to move back and live in Missoula.

            "For sure, it is murky. The Legislature caps the amount local governments can raise from property taxes. When the Legislature cuts the tax rates for some property classes, the total taxable value in the entire local jurisdiction decreases. When the taxable value goes down, so does the amount of revenue for that jurisdiction. The local jurisdiction would have to raise its mill levies on all property owners to maintain revenue levels. The increased mill levies are then applied to the remaining property in the jurisdiction, most significantly to residential property. As a result, local revenue remains constant, but the obligation to support local government functions shifts to homeowners and other property owners.\n\nDetermining what the property taxes will be on a piece of property is complicated and requires a series of steps. The Department of Revenue is responsible for appraising \u2013 or valuing \u2013 property in the state to determine the market value. The Legislature then assigns a tax rate to each class of property and multiplies that tax rate by the property\u2019s market value to determine the taxable value. Local taxing jurisdictions \u2013 cities and counties \u2013 apply the mill levies to the property\u2019s taxable value to determine taxes owed.",

            "Here\u2019s a start: cancel all contracts with consultants, and fire everyone with the word \u201cclimate\u201d \u201cequity\u201d or \u201ccoordinator\u201d in their job title. I care a lot about climate change and equity but those are feel-good do-nothing jobs and everyone knows it",

            "$111 million budget. 1/200 would be $555k. I can assure you the City is spending more than that on consultants alone, much more when you add in the do-nothing jobs.

            "For some reason I had $200m floating in my head, but is that the enterprise fund total? So ya, my percentages were off a bit.\n\nMy larger point is that it\u2019s not enough to say, fund an expansion of fire services. \n\nBy the way, \u201cThe City of Missoula in 2021 secured $847,000 in federal funding to study the Brooks Street corridor and a proposal to convert it to a Bus Rapid Transit system, along with other pedestrian improvements\u201d - so again, not all of this is local money. \n\nAlso, some of them are legitimate needs, or we can\u2019t simply pretend as if we can just recoup the entire cost. We needed code reform. Doing it in house should cost less, but it doesn\u2019t cost nothing \n\nSo like, I guess all that\u2019s to say, I\u2019m down to reform what we do in house, and I think we agree mostly on the specifics here - I just don\u2019t see it fixing the problem it\u2019s brought up to fix"

They are all trained in deescalation when a person is in crisis. This is all public knowledge and should be evaluated before making decisions. The future could also mean no firefighters being hired due to low wages and extremely high rentals and/or home listings. This is a scary thought with the number of calls for people in crisis rising and you all want the fire dept. to respond to your emergencies in such a fast time. Response time WILL fall if this is the case as it probably already has. Call the fire chief with these MST vs PD questions. They can let you know all the details.

A little over 66% of the 2019 calls were for medical assistance and rescue while fire responses, hazardous materials response, false alarms and a variety of other calls made up the difference.\"\n\nI wish there was a deeper breakout of which fire department vehicles and how many staff respond to medical assistance calls.\n\nThere is a national issue with fire departments responding with multiple staff, vehicles and equipment to non-fire calls. It would be nice to see, prior to proposing a levy, that the City of Missoula did a deeper look at who and what responds to which calls and, based on data, perhaps revise who replies for which calls. Like doing triage:\n\nLevel 1: Mental health crisis, no threat to public safety. Send the Mobile Response Team (MRT).\n\nLevel 2: Mental health crisis, no threat to public safety,  minor medical assistance needed. Send in the MRT and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). (And one EMS truck, not the hook and ladder - hyperbole.)\n\nLevel 3: Mental health crisis, potential or actual threat to public safety. Send in the MRT, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Police Department PD.\n\nLevel 4: Medical emergency. Send EMS.\n\nLevel 5: Medical emergency with law enforcement needed (like a bad car crash on Reserve). Send EMS, PD and Fire Engine(s).\n\nEtc.\n\nWithout data, it's hard to know that the current response systems are the best ones. \n\n And without data, it's like staffing a downtown bar on a Tuesday night in February the same as it would be staffed on the Saturday night of Homecoming weekend.",

We would want to try and ensure each individual gets the best care and best outcome. That unfortunately isn't real life and so we have to make a decision. Do we do what's best for more people? Or do what's best for a minority that meets the requirements of being \"normal\" to the CIS majority? \n\nWhich is worth more in your eyes? If it's strictly numbers and the values of the individuals are equal it's a clear choice for allowing the medical care."
