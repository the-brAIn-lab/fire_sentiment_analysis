Opening \"pumps and valves\" isn‚Äôt really accurate, but there is a real plan to build an underground water tunnel from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California, called the **Delta Conveyance Project**: [https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance](https://water.ca.gov/deltaconveyance)\\n\\nA TL;DR of the project:\\n\\n\\\\- The plan was proposed the 1960s, but the project has been delayed for decades due to debates over costs, logistics, and environmental impacts.\\n\\n\\\\- It gained traction again in 2016 and was approved by Gavin Newsom in 2019.\\n\\nTo expand on the main challenges: Firstly, the actual cost to build it goes up the longer it\\'s delayed (inflation). Secondly, there are logistical difficulties, as it\\'s a very deep and very long tunnel.  Thirdly, is the environmental impact. This has caused the most contentious debates, as the water tunnel could potentially impact the health of the delta ecosystem.\\n\\nOne example that keeps cropping up is around a species of fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta called the **delta smelt**, which are considered an \"indicator species\". If the smelt have a stable population, the water quality is good. If the smelt population declines, the water quality is bad. Protections for the delta smelt are about the Delta\\'s ecosystem and water quality, rather than the fish specifically. There is more about the environmental impact report for the San Juaquin delta released by the CA Department of Water Resources here: [https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/Dec-23/DWR-Releases-Final-Environmental-Impact-Report-for-Delta-Conveyance-Project)',\n",

Enough of the snow melt, however, is still allowed to flow into the deltas to maintain fragile delta ecosystems.\\n\\nTrump has been wanting the state to shunt more of that water away from the deltas and into the aqueduct system, to make more available for agricultural use and urban populations (powerful California farmers, and developers).\\n\\nHe's now using the devastating fires in the Palisades and Altadena as a pretense for his executive order to take control of California water resources and direct them how he wishes.\\n\\nBased on his justification, it's a dumb idea because the Santa Ynez reservoir being empty, and the hydrants running dry, are not due to lack of water from the north. The Santa Ynez reservoir had been emptied last February in anticipation of repairs for a tear in its cover. The hydrants ran dry because the demand during the unprecedented fires (estimated to be 25,000 gallons per minute) caused three 1 million gallon water tanks up in the hills to run dry, and the pumping stations could not pump fast enough to meet the demand. However it may not have made a significant difference because the primary issue was that firefighters were facing  firestorm with hurricane force winds that grounded air support, the primary instrument in fighting wildfires.\\n\\nThe claim that shunting more water south to fight fires also ignores the fact that there's no place to hold additional water when existing reservoirs are full, and we have ocean water we can use to fight fires if necessary when the fire is close enough to the coast.\",\n",

There already isn‚Äôt enough water to meet demand, especially in drought years when farmers are often forced to let their crops and orchards die for lack of water.\\n\\nThe huge farms in Imperial County get their water from the Colorado River via a separate canal system. The water sent down the Aqueduct largely goes to supply homes and businesses in southern CA, or in the words of northern CV farmers ‚Äúnothing but pools and golf courses‚Äù. They despise the LA region for always demanding more water almost as much as they despise the Delta smelt, an endangered fish species that has become a target because of the small percentage of water allowed to flow out of reservoirs and down the rivers to barely sustain the riparian and Delta ecosystems and prevent salt water intrusion, something local farmers consider ‚Äúa waste of precious water‚Äù. \\n\\nI guarantee that neither northern CV farmers nor the environmental community want to send more water down south.
